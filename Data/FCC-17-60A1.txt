I. INTRODUCTION
1. Americans cherish a free and open Internet.  And for almost twenty years, the Internet 
flourished under a light-touch regulatory approach.  It was a framework that our nation’s elected leaders 
put in place on a bipartisan basis.  President Clinton and a Republican Congress passed the 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, which established the policy of the United States “to preserve the
vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet . . . unfettered by Federal or State 
regulation.”
1
2. During this time, the Internet underwent rapid, and unprecedented, growth.
2
  Internet 
service providers (ISPs) invested over $1.5 trillion in the Internet ecosystem
3
and American consumers 
enthusiastically responded.  Businesses developed in ways that the policy makers could not have 
fathomed even a decade ago.  Google, Facebook, Netflix, and countless other online businesses launched 
in this country and became worldwide success stories.  The Internet became an ever-increasing part of the 
American economy, offering new and innovative changes in how we work, learn, receive medical care, 
and entertain ourselves.
4
3. But two years ago, the FCC changed course.  It decided to apply utility-style regulation to 
the Internet.  This decision represented a massive and unprecedented shift in favor of government control 
of the Internet.
4. The Commission’s Title II Order has put at risk online investment and innovation, 
threatening the very open Internet it purported to preserve.  Investment in broadband networks declined.  
Internet service providers have pulled back on plans to deploy new and upgraded infrastructure and 
services to consumers.  This is particularly true of the smallest Internet service providers that serve 
consumers in rural, low-income, and other underserved communities.  Many good-paying jobs were lost 
as the result of these pull backs.  And the order has weakened Americans’ online privacy by stripping the 
Federal Trade Commission—the nation’s premier consumer protection agency—of its jurisdiction over 
ISPs’ privacy and data security practices.
5. Today, we take a much-needed first step toward returning to the successful bipartisan 
framework that created the free and open Internet and, for almost twenty years, saw it flourish.  By 
proposing to end the utility-style regulatory approach that gives government control of the Internet, we 
aim to restore the market-based policies necessary to preserve the future of Internet Freedom, and to 
reverse the decline in infrastructure investment, innovation, and options for consumers put into motion by 
the FCC in 2015.  Our actions today continue our critical work to promote broadband deployment to rural

II. BACKGROUND
6. Long before the commercialization of the Internet, federal law drew a line between the 
heavily regulated common carrier services and more lightly regulated services that went beyond mere 
transmission.  Starting in 1966, the Commission initiated the Computer Inquiries,
6
which created a 
dichotomy between basic and enhanced services.
7
  Basic services offered “pure transmission capability 
over a communications path that is virtually transparent in terms of its interaction with customer supplied 
information”
8
and were “regulated under Title II of the [Communications] Act.”
9
  Enhanced services were 
“any offering over the telecommunications network which is more than a basic transmission service.  In 
an enhanced service, for example, computer processing applications are used to act on the content, code, 
protocol, and other aspects of the subscriber’s information.”
10
  Unlike basic services, the Commission 
found that “enhanced services should not be regulated under the Act.”
11
7. Just two years later, the federal courts would draw a similar line in resolving the 
government’s antitrust case against AT&T.  The Modification of Final Judgment (MFJ) of 1982 
distinguished between “telecommunications services,” which Bell Operating Companies could offer when 
“actually regulated by tariff,”
12
and “information services,” including “data processing and other 
computer-related services”
13
and “electronic publishing services,”
14
which Bell Operating Companies 
were prohibited from offering entirely.
15
8. In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, intended to “promote competition and reduce 
regulation,”
16
President Clinton and Congress drew a line between lightly regulated “information 
services” and more heavily regulated “telecommunications services.”
17
  They also found that the “Internet 
and other interactive computer services have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a minimum

Preamble, Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (1996) (describing the purpose of 
the 1996 Act as “[a]n Act [t]o promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher 
quality services for American telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new 
telecommunications technologies”).

of government regulation”
18
and declared it the policy of the United States to “promote the continued 
development of the Internet and other interactive computer services and other interactive media” and “to 
preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive 
computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation.”
19
  The 1996 Act went on to define 
“interactive computer service” to include “any information service, system, or access software provider 
that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a 
service or system that provides access to the Internet . . . .”
20
9. Congress weighed in again two years later.  Five Senators—John Ashcroft, Wendell 
Ford, John F. Kerry, Spencer Abraham, and Ron Wyden—wrote the Commission that “[n]othing in the 
1996 Act or its legislative history suggests that Congress intended to alter the current classification of 
Internet and other information services or to expand traditional telephone regulation to new and advanced 
services.”
21
  These five members further warned that if the Commission “subject[ed] some or all 
information service providers to telephone regulation, it seriously would chill the growth and 
development of advanced services to the detriment of our economic and educational well-being.”
22
10. For the next 16 years, the Commission repeatedly followed their advice, opting for a 
light-touch approach to the Internet that favored discrete and targeted actions over traditional pre-emptive, 
sweeping regulation of Internet service providers.  In the 1998 Stevens Report, the Commission 
comprehensively reviewed the Act’s definitions as they applied to the emerging technology of the Internet 
and concluded that Internet access service was properly classified as an information service.
23
  The 
Stevens Report exhaustively reviewed the text and legislative history of the Telecommunications Act, 
along with the agency’s own administrative precedent and the courts’ administration of antitrust law.
24
  
Looking to the Act’s text, the Commission concluded that “Internet access providers do not offer a pure 
transmission path; they combine computer processing, information provision, and other computer-
mediated offerings with data transport,”
25
and it “recognize[d] the unique qualities of the Internet, and 
[did] not presume that legacy regulatory frameworks are appropriately applied to it.”
26
  Further, even 
“address[ing] the classification of Internet access service de novo” the Stevens Report reached the same 
conclusion:  Internet access service is an information service according to the statute.
27
  The Stevens 
Report also found that subjecting Internet service providers and other information service providers to 
“the broad range of Title II constraints,” would “seriously curtail the regulatory freedom that the

See, e.g., id., 13 FCC Rcd at 11513-14, 11520, 11536–37, paras. 27, 39, 74–75.  The Stevens Report also noted 
that “[s]ince Computer II, we have made it clear that offerings by non-facilities-based providers combining 
communications and computing components should always be deemed enhanced,” while “the matter is more 
complicated when it comes to offerings by facilities-based providers.” Id. at 11530, para. 60.

Commission concluded in Computer II was important to the healthy and competitive development of the 
enhanced-services industry.”
28
11. In the 2002 Cable Modem Order, the Commission classified broadband Internet access 
service over cable systems as an “interstate information service.”
29
  The Commission did so based on the 
“functions that cable modem service makes available to its end users,”
30
on the fact that the 
“telecommunications component is not, however, separable from the data-processing capabilities of the 
service,”
31
and is an information service “regardless of whether subscribers use all of the functions 
provided as part of the service, such as e-mail or web-hosting, and regardless of whether every cable 
modem service provider offers each function that could be included in the service.”
32
  The Commission 
was also guided by its belief that “‘broadband services should exist in a minimal regulatory environment 
that promotes investment and innovation in a competitive market,’”
33
and the knowledge that regulatory 
uncertainty “may discourage investment and innovation.”
34
12. In June 2005, the Supreme Court decisively upheld the Commission’s 2002 classification 
of broadband Internet access service over cable systems as a lightly-regulated Title I information 
service.
35
13. In 2004, then-FCC Chairman Michael Powell announced four principles for Internet 
freedom to further ensure that the Internet would remain a place for free and open innovation with 
minimal regulation.
36
  These four “Internet freedoms” include the freedom to access lawful content, the 
freedom to use applications, the freedom to attach personal devices to the network, and the freedom to 
obtain service plan information.
37
14. In the 2005 Wireline Broadband Classification Order, the Commission classified 
broadband Internet access service over wireline facilities as an information service.
38
  In reaching this 
conclusion, the Commission relied on the plain text of the Act, finding that “providers of wireline 
broadband Internet access service offer subscribers the ability to run a variety of applications that fit 
under the characteristics stated in the information service definition,”
39
and that users of wireline

broadband Internet access service were provided “more than [a] pure transmission” path whenever they 
accessed the Internet.
40
15. In 2005, the Commission also unanimously endorsed the four Internet freedoms in the 
Internet Policy Statement.
41
  The Internet Policy Statement announced the Commission’s intent to 
“incorporate [these] principles into its ongoing policymaking activities” in order to “foster creation, 
adoption and use of Internet broadband content, applications, services and attachments, and to ensure 
consumers benefit from the innovation that comes from competition.”
42
16. In the 2006 BPL-Enabled Broadband Order, the Commission concluded that broadband 
Internet access service over power lines was properly classified as an information service.
43
  This decision 
established “a minimal regulatory environment” which promoted “ubiquitous availability of broadband to 
all Americans.”
44
  The Commission noted that broadband-powerline-enabled Internet access service 
“combines computer processing, information provision, and computer interactivity with data transport, 
[which] enable[es] end users to run a variety of applications,”
45
and concluded that classification as an 
information service “encourage[es] the deployment of broadband Internet access services.”
46
17. In the 2007 Wireless Broadband Internet Access Order, the Commission classified 
wireless broadband Internet access service as an information service, again recognizing the “minimal 
regulatory environment” that promoted the “ubiquitous availability of broadband to all Americans.”
47
  
Consistent with its prior interpretations, the Commission concluded that “wireless broadband Internet 
access service offers a single, integrated service to end users, Internet access, that inextricably combines 
the transmission of data with computer processing, information provision, and computer interactivity, for 
the purpose of enabling end users to run a variety of applications.”
48
  The Commission also found that 
“mobile wireless broadband Internet access service is not a ‘commercial mobile radio service’ as that 
term is defined in the Act and implemented in the Commission’s rules.”
49
18. In the 2008 Comcast-BitTorrent Order, the Commission sought to directly enforce 
federal Internet policy consistent with the Internet Policy Statement, finding Comcast’s actions 
“contravene[d] . . . federal policy” by “significantly imped[ing] consumers’ ability to access the content

and use the applications of their choice.”
50
  In 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit 
rejected the Commission’s action, holding that the Commission had not justified its action as a valid 
exercise of ancillary authority.
51
19. In response, the Commission adopted the 2010 Open Internet Order, where once again 
the Commission specifically rejected more heavy-handed regulation of broadband Internet access 
service.
52
  Instead, the Open Internet Order relied on, among other things, newly-claimed regulatory 
authority under section 706 of the Telecommunications Act to establish no-blocking and no-
unreasonable-discrimination rules as well as a requirement that broadband Internet access service 
providers “publicly disclose accurate information regarding the network management practices, 
performance, and commercial terms of its broadband Internet access services.”
53
  In doing so, the 
Commission distinguished between fixed and mobile broadband Internet access services, reasoning that 
the latter “presents special considerations that suggest differences in how and when open Internet 
protections should apply.”
54
20. In 2014, the D.C. Circuit vacated the no-blocking and no-unreasonable-discrimination 
rules adopted in the Open Internet Order, finding that the rules impermissibly regulated broadband 
Internet access service providers as common carriers,
55
in conflict with the Commission’s prior 
determination that broadband Internet access service was not a telecommunications service and that 
mobile broadband Internet access service was not a commercial mobile service.
56
  The D.C. Circuit 
nonetheless upheld the transparency rule,
57
claimed the Commission had authority to regulate broadband 
Internet access service providers under section 706 of the Telecommunications Act, and suggested that 
no-blocking and no-unreasonable-discrimination rules might be permissible if Internet service providers 
could engage in individualized bargaining.

because the Commission was bound in Comcast by a prior Commission determination that section 706 did not

proposing to rely on section 706 of the Telecommunications Act to adopt enforceable rules using the 
court’s “roadmap.”

broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act.”

  Three months later, the Commission 
adopted the Title II Order, reclassifying broadband Internet access services from information services to 
telecommunications services.
61
  In doing so, the Commission found it necessary to forbear from enforcing 
the “vast majority of rules adopted under Title II,” including “30 statutory provisions[,]” and to render 
“over 700 codified rules inapplicable.”
62
  The Commission adopted no-blocking, no-throttling, and no-
paid-prioritization rules, as well as a general Internet conduct standard and “enhancements” to the 
transparency rule.
63
In 2016, a divided panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Title II 
Order in United States Telecom Ass’n v. FCC, with the D.C. Circuit denying petitions for rehearing of the 
case en banc.
64
  
III. ENDING PUBLIC-UTILITY REGULATION OF THE INTERNET
23. Between enactment of the Telecommunications Act and the 2015 adoption of the Title II 
Order, the free and open Internet flourished:  Providers invested over $1.5 trillion to construct networks; 
high-speed Internet access proliferated at affordable rates; and consumers were able to enjoy all that the 
Internet had to offer.  In 2015, the Commission abruptly departed from its prior posture and classified 
broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service subject to public-utility regulations 
under Title II.
24. Today, we propose to reinstate the information service classification of broadband 
Internet access service and return to the light-touch regulatory framework first established on a bipartisan 
basis during the Clinton Administration.  We also propose to reinstate the determination that mobile 
broadband Internet access service is not a commercial mobile service.
A. Reinstating the Information Service Classification of Broadband Internet Access 
Service
25. Our proposal to classify broadband Internet access service as an information service is 
based on a number of factors.  First, we examine the text, structure, and history of the Communications 
Act and the Telecommunications Act, combined with the technical details of how the Internet works.  
Second, we examine Commission precedent.  Third, we examine public policy and our goal of benefiting 
consumers through greater innovation, investment, and competition.  We seek comment on our proposals 
and these analyses.

1. The Text and Structure of the Act
26. We start with the text of the Act itself.  Section 3 of the Act defines an “information 
service” as “the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, 
retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications, and includes electronic 
publishing, but does not include any use of any such capability for the management, control, or operation 
of a telecommunications system or the management of a telecommunications service.”
65
  Section 3 
defines a “telecommunications service” as “the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the 
public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the 
facilities used.”
66
  Section 3 also defines “telecommunications,” used in each of the prior two definitions, 
as “the transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s 
choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received.”
67
27. We believe that Internet service providers offer the “capability for generating, acquiring, 
storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via 
telecommunications.”
68
  Whether posting on social media or drafting a blog, a broadband Internet user is 
able to generate and make available information online.  Whether reading a newspaper’s website or 
browsing the results from a search engine, a broadband Internet user is able to acquire and retrieve 
information online.  Whether it’s an address book or a grocery list, a broadband Internet user is able to 
store and utilize information online.  Whether uploading filtered photographs or translating text into a 
foreign language, a broadband Internet user is able to transform and process information online. In short, 
broadband Internet access service appears to offer its users the “capability” to perform each and every one 
of the functions listed in the definition—and accordingly appears to be an information service by 
definition.  We seek comment on this analysis.  Can broadband Internet users indeed access these 
capabilities?  Are there other capabilities that a broadband Internet user may receive with service?  If 
broadband Internet access service does not afford one of the listed capabilities to users, what effect would 
that have on our statutory analysis?  More fundamentally, we seek comment on how the Commission 
should assess whether a broadband provider is “offering” a capability.  Should we assess this from the 
perspective of the user, from the provider, or through some other lens?
28. In the Cable Modem Order, the Commission recognized that broadband Internet users 
often used services from third parties:  “[S]ubscribers, by ‘click-through’ access, may obtain many 
functions from companies with whom the cable operator has not even a contractual relationship.  For 
example, a subscriber to Comcast’s cable modem service may bypass that company’s web browser, 
proprietary content, and email.  The subscriber is free to download and use instead, for example, a web 
browser from Netscape, content from Fox News, and e-mail in the form of Microsoft’s ‘Hotmail.’”
69
  It 
nonetheless found the classification appropriate “regardless of whether subscribers use all of the functions 
provided as part of the service, such as e-mail or web-hosting, and regardless of whether every cable 
modem service provider offers each function that could be included in the service.”
70
  In the Title II 
Order, the Commission in turn found that “consumers are very likely to use their high-speed Internet 
connections to take advantage of competing services offered by third parties”
71
and asserted the service 
“is useful to consumers today primarily as a conduit for reaching modular content, applications, and

services that are provided by unaffiliated third parties.”
72
  We seek comment on how consumers are using 
broadband Internet access service today.  It appears that, as in 2002 and 2013, broadband Internet users 
“obtain many functions from companies” other than their Internet service provider.  It also appears that 
many broadband Internet users rely on services, such as Domain Name Service (DNS) and email, from 
their ISP.  Is that correct?  If not, what services are broadband Internet users accessing from what 
providers?  More generally, we seek comment on the relevance of this analysis.  The definition of 
“information service” speaks to the “capability” to perform certain functions.  Is a consumer capable of 
accessing these online services without Internet access service?  Could a consumer access these online 
services using traditional telecommunications services like telephone service or point-to-point special 
access?
73
  Or are we correct that offering Internet access is precisely what makes the service capable of 
“generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available 
information” to consumers?
29. In contrast, Internet service providers do not appear to offer “telecommunications,” i.e., 
“the transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user’s choosing, 
without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received,” to their users.  For one, 
broadband Internet users do not typically specify the “points” between and among which information is 
sent online.  Instead, routing decisions are based on the architecture of the network, not on consumers’ 
instructions, and consumers are often unaware of where online content is stored.  Domain names must be 
translated into IP addresses (and there is no one-to-one correspondence between the two).  Even IP 
addresses may not specify where information is transmitted to or from because caching servers store and 
serve popular information to reduce network loads.  In short, broadband Internet users are paying for the 
access to information “with no knowledge of the physical location of the server where that information 
resides.”
74
  We believe that consumers want and pay for these functionalities that go beyond mere 
transmission—and that they have come to expect them as part and parcel of broadband Internet access 
service.  We seek comment on our analysis.  How are broadband Internet users’ requests for information 
handled by Internet service providers today?  What functionalities beyond mere transmission do Internet 
service providers incorporate into their broadband Internet access service?  We particularly seek comment 
on the Title II Order’s assertion that the phrase “points specified by the user” is ambiguous
75
—how 
should we interpret that phrase so that it carries with it independent meaning and is not mere surplusage?  
Is it enough, as the Title II Order asserted, for a broadband Internet user to specify the information he is 
trying to access but not the “points” between or among which the information will be transmitted?  Does 
it matter that the Internet service provider specifies the points between and among which information will 
be transmitted?

In the past, rate-of-return carriers have offered broadband Internet access transmission service as a common-
carriage last-mile service that transmits data between and end user and an ISP.  Wireline Broadband Classification 
Order, 20 FCC Rcd at 14899–900, paras. 86–88.  Absent an ISP at the other end, however, broadband Internet 
access transmission service only transmits data to a carrier’s central office (or other aggregation point) as it does not 
itself offer the capabilities that come with Internet access.

We note that the Title II Order asserted that “[i]t is not uncommon in the toll-free arena for a single number to 
route to multiple locations, and such a circumstance does not transform that service to something other than 
telecommunications.”  Title II Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 5761–62, para. 361.  Despite that assertion, the Commission 
has expressly found that the management of toll-free numbers is “not a common carrier service” and that providers 
that manage toll-free numbers “do not need to be carriers.”  800 Data Base Access Tariffs and the 800 Service

30. For another, Internet service providers routinely change the form or content of the 
information sent over their networks—for example, by using firewalls to block harmful content or using 
protocol processing to interweave IPv4 networks with IPv6 networks.  The Commission has 
acknowledged that broadband Internet networks must be reasonably managed since at least the 2005 
Internet Policy Statement.
77
  We believe that consumers want and pay for these functionalities that go 
beyond mere transmission—and that they have come to expect them as part and parcel of broadband 
Internet access service.  We seek comment on our analysis.  What constitutes a “change in the form” of 
information?  If not the protocol-processing for internetworking or other protocol-processing performed 
as part of Internet access service, how should we interpret this phase so it carries with it independent 
meaning and is not mere surplusage?  How could we plausibly conclude that it is not a “change in the . . . 
content” to use firewalls and other reasonable network management tools to shield broadband Internet 
users from unwanted intrusions and thereby alter what information reaches the user for the user’s benefit?  
We seek comment on other ways in which Internet service providers change the form or content of 
information to facilitate a broadband Internet user’s experience online.
31. Other provisions of the Act appear to confirm our analysis that broadband Internet access 
services should be classified as information services.  For instance, section 230 defines an interactive 
computer service to mean “any information service, system, or access software provider that provides or 
enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system 
that provides access to the Internet and such systems operated or services offered by libraries or 
educational institutions.”
78
  On its face, the plain language of this provision deems Internet access service 
an information service.  We seek comment on this analysis, on the language of section 230, and on how it 
should impact our classification of broadband Internet access service.
32. Section 231 is even more direct.  It expressly states that “Internet access service” “does 
not include telecommunications services.”
79
  And it defines Internet access service as one offering many 
capabilities (like an information service): “a service that enables users to access content, information, 
electronic mail, or other services offered over the Internet, and may also include access to proprietary 
content, information, and other services as part of a package of services offered to consumers.”
80
  
Although inserted into the Communications Act one year after the Telecommunications Act’s passage
81
and previously interpreted to “clarify that section 231 was not intended to impair our or a state 
commission’s ability to regulate basic telecommunications services,”
82
this language on its face makes 
clear that Internet access service is not a telecommunications service.  We seek comment on this analysis, 
on the language of section 231, and on how it should impact our classification of broadband Internet 
access service.
33. The structure of Title II appears to be a poor fit for broadband Internet access service.  In 
the Title II Order, the Commission, on its own motion, forbore either in whole or in part on a permanent 
or temporary basis from 30 separate sections of Title II as well as from other provisions of the Act and

Commission rules.
83
  The significant forbearance the Commission granted in the Title II Order suggests 
the highly prescriptive regulatory framework of Title II is unsuited for the dynamic broadband Internet 
access service marketplace.  We seek comment on this analysis, and on what weight we should give this 
analysis in examining the future of this model of regulation.
34. The purposes of the Telecommunications Act appear to be better served by classifying 
broadband Internet access service as an information service.  Congress passed the Telecommunications 
Act to “promote competition and reduce regulation”
84
and “[n]othing in the 1996 Act or its legislative 
history suggests that Congress intended to alter the current classification of Internet and other information 
services or to expand traditional telephone regulation to new and advanced services.”
85
  Or as Senator 
John McCain put it, “[i]t certainly was not Congress’s intent in enacting the supposedly pro-competitive, 
deregulatory 1996 Act to extend the burdens of current Title II regulation to Internet services, which 
historically have been excluded from regulation.”
86
Or as Congress codified its intent in section 230:  It is 
the policy of the United States “to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists 
for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation.”
87
  An 
information service classification would “reduce regulation” and preserve a free market “unfettered by 
Federal or State regulation”—but a telecommunications service classification would not.  Indeed, as 
Judge Brown of the D.C. Circuit recently noted, “[b]y incorporating [the] FCC’s distinction between 
‘enhanced service’ and ‘basic service’ into the statutory scheme, and by placing Internet access on the 
‘enhanced service’ side, Congress prohibited the FCC from construing the ‘offering’ of 
‘telecommunications service’ to be the ‘information service’ of Internet access.”
88
  We seek comment on 
this analysis, as well as whether there are any other provisions of the Communications Act or 
Telecommunications Act that establish congressional intent with respect to the appropriate regulatory 
framework for broadband Internet access services.
35. More broadly, we seek comment on the text, structure, and purposes of the 
Communications Act and the Telecommunications Act, as well as any additional facts about what Internet 
service providers offer, how broadband Internet access service works, and what broadband Internet users 
expect that might inform our analysis.
36. We seek special comment on two aspects of the Title II Order’s interpretation of the Act.  
First, the Title II Order claimed its interpretation sprang in part from a change in “broadband providers’ 
marketing and pricing strategies, which emphasize speed and reliability of transmission separately from 
and over the extra features of the service packages they offer.”
89
  It claimed this marketing “leaves a 
reasonable consumer with the impression that a certain level of transmission capability—measured in 
terms of ‘speed’ or ‘reliability’—is being offered in exchange for the subscription fee, even if 
                                                     
83

complementary services are also included as part of the offer.”
90
  We note that even before the Cable 
Modem Order, the Commission recognized that Internet service providers marketed the speed of their 
connections.
91
  We seek comment on whether Internet service providers’ marketing has decidedly 
changed in recent decades.
92
  More generally, we seek comment on the relevance of this argument.  
Neither statutory service definition speaks of speed or reliability, and there is little reason to think 
consumers might want a fast or reliable “transmission . . . of information” but not a fast or reliable 
“capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making 
available information.”  Indeed, many of the advertisements discussed by the Title II Order speak directly 
to the capabilities offered through high-speed service.
93
  We seek comment on this analysis and on any 
other relevant facts regarding whether broadband Internet users receive the capabilities of an information 
service or the mere transmission between points of a user’s choosing of a telecommunications service.
37. Second, the Title II Order found that DNS
94
and caching
95
used in broadband Internet 
access service were just used “for the management, control, or operation of a telecommunications system 
or the management of a telecommunications service.”
96
  The Commission has previously held this 
category applies to “adjunct-to-basic” functions that are “incidental” to a telecommunications service’s 
underlying use and “do not alter [its] fundamental character.”
97
  As such, these functions generally are not 
“useful to end users, rather than carriers.”
98
  We seek comment on how DNS and caching functions are 
now used, whether they benefit end users, Internet service providers, or both, and whether they fit within 
the adjunct-to-basic exception.  How would broadband Internet access service work without DNS or 
caching?  Would removing DNS have a merely incidental effect on broadband Internet users, or would it 
fundamentally change their online experience?  Absent caching, would broadband Internet users that now 
expect high-quality video streaming see only incidental changes or more fundamental changes?  Are there 
other ways that DNS or caching are used for “for the management, control, or operation of a 
telecommunications system”?  Are there any other aspects of the Title II Order’s treatment of DNS or 
caching that should be reconsidered here?

2. Commission Precedent Supports Classification as an Information Service
38. Our proposed classification of broadband Internet access service as an information 
service is firmly rooted in Commission precedent.  For two decades, a consistent bipartisan framework 
supported a free and open Internet.  That same consensus led to six separate Commission decisions 
confirming that Internet access service is an information service, subject to Title I.  Chairman Kennard 
first led the FCC in determining that Internet access service is an information service in the Stevens 
Report.
99
  Chairman Powell led the Commission to classify broadband Internet access service over cable 
systems as an information service in the Cable Modem Order.
100
  Chairman Martin led the Commission to 
classify several broadband Internet access services as information services in the Wireline Broadband 
Classification Order,
101
the BPL-Enabled Broadband Order,
102
and the Wireless Broadband Internet 
Access Order.
103
  Finally, Chairman Genachowski declined to reclassify broadband Internet access 
services in the Open Internet Order.
104
39. We believe the Commission under Democratic and Republican leadership alike was 
correct in these decisions to classify broadband Internet access service as an information service and that, 
20 years after the passage of the Telecommunications Act, we should be reluctant to second-guess the 
interpretations of those more likely to understand the contemporary meaning of the terms of the 
Telecommunications Act.  We seek comment on our assessment.  Did the Commission’s historical 
information service classification better enable flexibility in marketplace offerings?
105
  Did the regulatory 
certainty of maintaining the same regulatory environment for approximately three decades (since the 
Computer Inquiries) foster additional investment or innovative business models to benefit consumers?  
How should we evaluate the prior Commissions’ predictions of intermodal competition given the 4,559 
Internet service providers now in the market?  How many providers would likely have entered the market 
if traditional Title II regulation had been the norm?  What actual harms, if any, resulted from light-touch 
regulation?
40. The Commission has previously concluded that Congress formally codified information 
services and telecommunications services as two, mutually exclusive types of service in the 
Telecommunications Act.
106
  The Title II Order did not appear to disagree with this analysis, finding that 
broadband Internet access service was a telecommunications service and not an information service.
107
  
We believe this conclusion regarding mutual exclusivity is correct based on the text and history of the

41. The Commission has previously found that Congress intended the definitions of 
information service and telecommunications service in the Act to parallel those definitions in the MFJ and 
in the Computer Inquiries.
108
  The Title II Order apparently accepted these parallels.
109
  We thus seek 
comment on any evidence that the court in the MFJ thought that Internet access service was a 
telecommunications service.  Did the court and the Department of Justice intend to exclude Internet 
access services from the prohibitions on what Bell Operating Companies could offer?  Did the court and 
the Department of Justice intend for Internet access services to be regulated via tariff (as other 
telecommunications services were)?  We similarly seek comment on any evidence that the Commission in 
the Computer Inquiries thought that Internet access service was a basic service.  Did the Commission 
intend for facilities-based carriers to offer Internet access service without the protections of the Computer 
Inquiries (as they could for basic services)?  The Supreme Court has said that statutory interpretation 
“must be guided to a degree by common sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to delegate a 
policy decision of such economic and political magnitude to an administrative agency.”
110
  How is that 
canon relevant here?  
42. Finally, the Title II Order deviated further from Commission precedent to extend its 
authority to Internet traffic exchange or “interconnection,”
111
an area historically unregulated and beyond 
the Commission’s reach.  We believe Internet traffic exchange, premised on privately negotiated 
agreements or case-by-case basis, is not a telecommunications service.  Moreover, we find nothing in the 
Act that would extend our jurisdiction as previously suggested by the Title II Order.  We further do not 
believe there exists any non-Title II basis for the Commission to exercise ongoing regulatory oversight 
over Internet traffic exchange.  We accordingly propose to relinquish any authority over Internet traffic 
exchange.  We seek comment on the consequences and implications of relinquishing the Commission’s 
regulatory authority in this manner.
43. We note that the Commission’s Title II Order also went well beyond agency precedent in 
important ways.  For instance, the Commission did not limit its analysis to the “last mile” connections at 
issue in the Brand X and the FCC’s underlying proceeding in that case.  Rather, the Commission’s Title II
Order defined Internet access service as extending far deeper into the network.  We seek comment on the 
significance of this expansive departure from agency precedent.
3. Public Policy Supports Classification as an Information Service
44. The Commission’s decision to reclassify broadband Internet access service as a 
telecommunications service subject to Title II regulation has resulted in negative consequences for 
American consumers—including depressed broadband investment and reduced innovation because of 
increased regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty stemming from the rules adopted under Title II.  
As providers have devoted more resources to complying with new regulations, the threat of regulatory 
enforcement of vague rules and standards has dampened providers’ incentive to invest and innovate.  
Additionally, although reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service 
has led to significant regulatory burdens, it has not solved any discrete, identifiable problems.  Restoring 
broadband Internet access service to its previous status as an information service subject to Title I is in the 
public interest because it will alleviate the harms caused by Title II reclassification.  We seek detailed 
comment on this analysis below.
45. Following the 2014 Notice and in the lead up to the Title II Order, Internet service 
providers stated that the increased regulatory burdens of Title II classification would lead to depressed

investment.
112
  Recent data indicate how accurate those predictions were. A recent study indicates that 
capital expenditure from the nation’s twelve largest Internet service providers has fallen by $3.6 billion, a 
5.6% decline relative to 2014 levels.
113
  Another study indicated that between 2011 and 2015, the threat of 
reclassification reduced telecommunications investment by about 20–30%, or about $30–40 billion 
annually.
114
  Other sources also explain that other countries’ experiences should caution the United States 
that ongoing utility-style regulation should be expected to have even more dramatic impacts on 
investment beyond what has already occurred.
115
  Other interested parties have come to different 
conclusions.
116
46. We believe that these reduced expenditures are a direct and unavoidable result of Title II 
reclassification, and exercise our predictive judgment that reversing the Title II classification and 
restoring broadband Internet access service to a Title I service will increase investment.
117
   Among other 
things, Internet service providers have finite resources, and requiring providers to divert some of those 
resources to newly imposed regulatory requirements adopted under Title II will, unsurprisingly, reduce 
expenditures that benefit consumers.  We seek comment on how the burdens associated with Title II

regulation have impacted broadband investment and, as a result, consumers.  Has the Commission’s 
increased regulation of broadband adversely impacted broadband investment and innovation?  What 
impact has Title II reclassification had on providers’ business models, including any lost opportunity 
costs, and how has this impact been passed on to consumers?  Is there any evidence that increased 
regulation has promoted broadband investment, as some claim?  What are the long-term implications of 
utility-style regulation with respect to capital expenditures on high-speed networks?
47. We also seek specific comment on how the classification of broadband Internet access 
service as a telecommunications service has impacted smaller broadband Internet access service 
providers, many of whom lack the dedicated compliance staffs and financial resources of the nation’s 
largest providers.  Before the Commission adopted the Title II Order, many small providers made it clear 
that reclassification would harm their businesses and the customers they serve.
118
  Since reclassification, 
small providers—including non-profit, municipal ISPs—have been forced to reduce their investment and 
halt the expansion of their networks, and slow, if not delay, the development and deployment of 
innovative new offerings.
119
  For example, one small ISP had planned to “triple the number of new base 
stations” that would be deployed each month to provide fixed wireless broadband service to new 
customers, but put those plans on hold as a result of the Commission’s reclassification.
120
  Other small 
providers have had to modify or abandon altogether past business models to account for increased 
compliance costs and depressed investment from outside investors.
121
  This depressed investment has had

particularly strong impacts on the deployment of broadband to previously unserved and rural areas.
122
  
What other impacts have small providers felt as a result of reclassification?  Have there been any 
corresponding benefits for small providers?
48. In addition to imposing significant regulatory costs on Internet service providers, Title II 
reclassification created significant regulatory uncertainty.  USTelecom specifically identified “regulatory 
uncertainty” as one of the causes of reduced investment.
123
  Regulatory uncertainty may have particularly 
significant effects on small Internet service providers, which may be poorly equipped to address the legal, 
technical, and financial burdens associated with an uncertain regulatory environment.
124
  That uncertainty 
has directly led to reduced investment, which has harmed consumers.
125
  We seek comment on what other 
effects regulatory uncertainty has had on broadband Internet access service providers’ investment 
decisions.
49. We also seek comment on other consumer benefits that would result from restoring 
broadband Internet access service classification to an information service, rather than subjecting these 
services to utility-style regulation.  We note that increased investment is likely to lead to a faster closing 
of the digital divide for rural and low-income consumers, higher speeds and more competition for all 
consumers, as well as more affordable prices.  We seek comment on the magnitude of these effects, and 
what further steps the Commission should take to maximize facilities-based investment and competition.  
Specifically, we seek comment on the trade-offs from changing the classification status.  We also seek 
comment more broadly on the effects on innovation of regulatory uncertainty, and other examples of 
reduced innovation from Internet service providers as a result of the Title II classification.

regulatory burdens make it more difficult to attract capital, and less capital makes it more difficult to comply with 
regulatory burdens.”). 
Federal Communications Commission FCC 17-60

50. We also seek comment on specific ways in which consumers were harmed under the 
light-touch regulatory framework that existed before the Commission’s Title II Order.  Much of the Title 
II Order focused extensively on hypothetical actions Internet service providers “might” take, and how 
those actions “might” harm consumers,
126
but the Title II Order only articulated four examples of actions 
Internet service providers arguably took to justify its adoption of the Internet conduct standard under Title 
II.
127
  Do these isolated examples justify the regulatory shift that Title II reclassification entailed?  Do 
such isolated examples constitute market failure sufficient to warrant pre-emptive, industry-wide 
regulation?  Were pre-existing federal and state competition and consumer protection regimes, in addition 
to private sector initiatives, insufficient to address such isolated examples, and if so, why?  What are the 
costs and benefits of pre-emptive, industry-wide regulation in such circumstances?  In particular, does 
that approach deter competition and competitive entry, and does it have unintended consequences with 
respect to infrastructure investment?  Do those unintended consequences outweigh any purported benefits 
in addressing such isolated cases pre-emptively?  Is there evidence of actual harm to consumers sufficient 
to support maintaining the Title II telecommunications service classification for broadband Internet access 
service?  Is there any evidence that the likelihood of these events occurring decreased with the shift to 
Title II?
51. Conversely, what, if any, changes have been made as a result of Title II reclassification 
that have had a positive impact on consumers?  Was Title II reclassification necessary for any of those 
changes to occur?  Is there any evidence, for example, that consumers’ online experiences and Internet 
access have improved due to policies adopted in the Title II Order?  
4. The Commission Has Legal Authority to Classify Broadband Internet 
Access Service as an Information Service
52. As the D.C. Circuit has held, “[i]t is axiomatic that administrative agencies may issue 
regulations only pursuant to authority delegated to them by Congress.”
128
  And that authority is not 
unbounded.  The Commission has authority, as the Supreme Court recognized in Brand X, to interpret the 
Communications Act, including ambiguous definitional provisions.
129
  However, when interpreting a 
statute it administers, the Commission, like all agencies, “must operate ‘within the bounds of reasonable 
interpretation.’ And reasonable statutory interpretation must account for both ‘the specific context in 
which . . . language is used’ and ‘the broader context of the statute as a whole.’”
130
  
53. An agency also is free to change its approach to interpreting and implementing a statute 
so long as it acknowledges that it is doing so and justifies the new approach.
131
  Evaluating the change in 
regulatory approach in the Title II Order, the D.C. Circuit majority in USTelecom applied a “highly 
deferential standard” to the agency’s predictive judgments regarding the investment effects of 
                                                     
126
See, e.g., Title II Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 5652, para. 121 (stating that “the no-blocking rule will not be as effective 
because broadband providers might otherwise engage in conduct that harms the open Internet but falls short of 
outright blocking”); at 5656, para. 127 (stating that “because of the very real concerns about the chilling effects that 
preferential treatment arrangements could have on the virtuous cycle of innovation, consumer demand, and 
investment, we adopt a bright-line rule banning paid prioritization arrangements”).
127
See Title II Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 5620, 5628, para. 65 & n.69 (discussing the Comcast and Madison River
proceedings), para. 79 & n.123 (discussing AT&T blocking FaceTime and Comcast exempting its video service 
from data caps when streamed over an Xbox).

reclassification,
132
and deferred to the Commission’s “‘evaluat[ion of] complex market conditions’” 
underlying its rejection of providers’ reliance interests in the prior classification.
133
  D.C. Circuit 
precedent also recognizes, however, that should the Commission’s predictions “prove erroneous, the 
Commission will need to reconsider” the associated regulatory actions “in accordance with its continuing 
obligation to practice reasoned decision-making.”
134
  We believe that the Commission’s predictions and 
expectations regarding broadband investment and the nature and effects of reclassification on the 
operation of the marketplace were mistaken and have not been borne out by subsequent events.  
Moreover, we believe that a restoration of the information service classification for broadband Internet 
access service is likely to increase infrastructure investment.  In such a case, principles of administrative 
law give us more than ample latitude to revisit our approach.  We seek comment on this overall approach, 
and we seek comment on these specific issues in the sections below.
54. Even more fundamentally, we believe that the Commission’s statutory interpretation in 
the Title II Order did not adequately reflect proper standards of statutory construction, and that classifying 
broadband Internet access service as an information service is the better reading of the statute, 
independent of the factual developments subsequent to the Title II Order.  We note that the Supreme 
Court has expressly upheld the Commission’s prior information service classification.
135
  We seek 
comment on this analysis.  Although the Title II Order’s telecommunications service classification was 
upheld in USTelecom, the court emphasized that it “sit[s] to resolve only legal questions presented and 
argued by the parties,’” and not “‘arguments a party could have made but did not.”
136
  Many arguments as 
to why an information service classification of broadband Internet access service reflects the better 
reading of ambiguous provisions of the Act were not addressed by the court because the arguments were 
raised in support of a claim that the Act unambiguously required a particular service classification.
137
  
Thus, although we are in any case free to revisit previously affirmed interpretations of ambiguous 
statutory language, we note that the USTelecom decision did not reach many aspects of the statutory 
analysis we propose here.  We seek comment on this analysis and on our reasoning that the statutory 
interpretation proposed in this Notice more faithfully adheres to the Act and reflects the better reading of 
the relevant provisions than the views adopted in the Title II Order.
B. Reinstating the Private Mobile Service Classification of Mobile Broadband Internet 
Access Service
55. We propose to classify all broadband Internet access services—both fixed and mobile—
as information services.  With respect to mobile broadband Internet access service, we further propose to

return it to its original classification as a private mobile service, and in conjunction to revisit the elements 
of the Title II Order that modified or reinterpreted key terms in section 332 of the Act and our 
implementing rules.  We seek comment on that proposal, including on the specific issues discussed 
below.  We also generally seek comment on whether certain and, if so, which, aspects of the D.C. 
Circuit’s analysis of mobile broadband Internet access service in USTelecom necessitate modifications or 
additions to the Commission’s proposals with respect to mobile broadband Internet access service here.
138
  
We also seek comment on the scope of the authority delegated by sections 332(d)(1)–(3) to the 
Commission to define or specify the terms used in section 332 and discussed below.
56. We propose to restore the meaning of “public switched network” under section 332(d)(2) 
to its pre-Title II Order focus on the traditional public switched telephone network.
139
  We find persuasive 
the Commission’s reasoning when originally adopting the prior definition,
140
which also appears more 
consistent with the historical usage of the term “public switched network,”
141
appears to better accord 
with the text of section 332(d)(2) by clearly covering only a single, integrated network,
142
and was not 
disturbed by Congress in amendments to section 332 of the Act.
143
  We seek comment on this analysis 
and our proposed approach.
57. We also propose to return to our prior definition of “interconnected service” by restoring 
the word “all” in the codified definition.
144
  Although the court in USTelecom found the deletion of “all” 
to be “of no consequence” to the reclassification of mobile broadband Internet access service, it did so 
based on an argument that the Commission never mentioned in its brief—namely, that mobile broadband 
users can reach telephone customers “via VoIP” and that this determination is sufficient (regardless of the 
deletion of the word “all”) to render mobile broadband Internet access service interconnected with the 
public switched network.
145
  We seek comment on that view and whether the Commission erred in 2015 
by modifying the definition based on the view that two separate networks can be interconnected if they do 
not allow all users to communicate with each other.
146
  The FCC’s prior decision in this respect appears to

Had all the elements of the Title II Order’s mobile broadband Internet access service classification remained, a 
future Commission might have incentives to continue pursuing such an approach to avoid the potentially absurd 
result that traditional wireless voice service no longer constituted commercial mobile service.  While not finding it a 
sufficient basis to reject the Title II Order’s treatment of mobile broadband Internet access service, the D.C. Circuit 
acknowledged the possibility that the revised definition of public switched network raised questions about whether 
(continued….)
Federal Communications Commission FCC 17-60
22
run contrary to the focus on a single, integrated network that we believe Congress likely intended in 
section 332(d)(2). We seek comment on these views.  In the Title II Order, the Commission noted that the 
prior definition of “interconnected service” would encompass a service that “provides general access to 
points on the PSN [but] also restricts calling in certain limited ways” (such as blocking of 900 numbers), 
but cited no evidence that the prior definition led to any confusion.
147
  We question the need for changes 
to the prior definition to account for that limited exception to general access, but nonetheless seek 
comment on whether modified rule language is warranted, and if so, what language targeted narrowly to 
that issue should be incorporated. 
58. We also seek comment on whether any other interpretations of section 332 or our 
implementing rules from the Title II Order should be revisited here in connection with our proposed 
classification of mobile broadband Internet access service.  For example, would a narrower interpretation 
of “capability” for purposes of the definition of “interconnected service” under our rules be warranted 
based on the Act or the regulatory history of that language?  Are there other interpretations that should be 
reconsidered?  In addition to the changes to the definitions in section 20.3 of the rules discussed above, 
would any additional changes to our codified rules be warranted?
59. In applying the definitions and interpretations of key terms in section 332 and our 
implementing rules under the proposals above, we also propose to reach the same conclusions regarding 
the application of those terms to mobile broadband Internet access service as we did in the Wireless 
Broadband Internet Access Order.
148
  We seek comment on that proposal and whether there have been 
any material changes in technology, the marketplace, or other facts that would warrant refinement or 
revision of any of that analysis. 
60. Furthermore, insofar as mobile broadband Internet access service is best interpreted to be 
an information service, we believe that likely also would counsel in favor of classifying it as a private 
mobile service to avoid the inconsistency of the service being both an information service and a common 
carrier service.  The Commission explained this reasoning when originally classifying mobile broadband 
Internet access service as both an information service and a private mobile service, and we propose to 
apply that same reasoning again here.
149
  We seek comment on this proposal. 
61. We also believe that mobile broadband Internet access service is not the “functional 
equivalent” of commercial mobile service,
150
and seek comment on that view.  The Commission 
previously has observed, in light of Congress’s determinations in section 332, that “very few mobile 
services that do not meet the definition of CMRS will be a close substitute for a commercial mobile radio 
service.”
151
  By contrast, we are concerned that the Title II Order’s test, which focuses on whether the 
service merely “enables ubiquitous access to the vast majority of the public,” would eviscerate the 
statutory scheme.
152
  We believe that the standard for demonstrating functional equivalency under our 
rules is instead more likely to properly implement section 332(d)(3) of the Act, and we thus propose to 
(Continued from previous page)                                                            
traditional wireless voice service was sufficiently interconnected with the public switched network to still constitute 
a commercial mobile service.  See USTelecom, 825 F.3d at 722.

reconsider the Title II Order’s position that the Commission is free to depart from that standard.
153
  In 
addition, the Title II Order made no claim that the functional equivalency standard in our rules was met 
by mobile broadband Internet access service, and we similarly propose here that it does not meet that 
standard.  We seek comment on these proposals and on any other or different definition of “functional
equivalent” that the FCC should adopt.
62. Given the apparent historical success of the wireless marketplace prior to the Title II 
Order, we anticipate that returning mobile broadband Internet access service to its original classification 
of a private mobile service and restoring prior definitions and interpretations of key concepts in section 
332 is likely to substantially benefit the wireless marketplace and consumers and have few, if any, policy 
disadvantages.  We seek comment on this view.  To the extent any commenters believe that these 
proposals will have negative policy consequences, we seek specific information regarding the scope or 
significance of any such consequences and whether they can be mitigated in whole or in part through 
modifications to our proposals.
C. Effects on Regulatory Structures Created by the Title II Order
63. The Title II Order imposed additional regulatory frameworks under Title II, including 
forbearance and privacy.  We seek comment on how we should treat those structures and proceedings 
moving forward.
64. Forbearance.  If we adopt our lead proposal to remove the Title II reclassification of 
broadband Internet access service, what effect does that action have on the provisions of the Act from 
which the Commission forbore in the Title II Order?  We believe that restoring the classification status of 
broadband Internet access service to an information service will render any additional forbearance moot 
in most cases.  We seek comment on this analysis.  At the same time, we seek comment on whether, with 
respect to broadband Internet access service, the Commission should maintain and extend forbearance to 
even more provisions of Title II as a way of further ensuring that our decision in this proceeding will 
prove to reduce regulatory burdens.
65. We also seek comment on the effect of reinstating an information service classification 
on providers that voluntarily offered broadband transmission on a common carrier basis under the 
Wireline Broadband Classification Order framework.
154
  The Title II Order allowed such providers to 
opt-in to the Title II Order’s forbearance framework.
155
  Should providers voluntarily electing to offer 
broadband transmission on a common carrier basis be able to do so under the Title II Order’s forbearance 
framework if we reclassify broadband Internet access service as an information service?  If not, what 
transition mechanisms are required for such providers that opted-in to the Title II Order’s forbearance 
framework to enable them to revert back to the Wireline Broadband Classification Order framework?  
Should we extend forbearance to any other rules or statutory provisions for carriers that choose to offer 
broadband transmission on a common carrier basis?
66. Section 222 Regulations.  Historically, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) protected 
the privacy of broadband consumers, policing every online company’s privacy practices consistently and 
initiating numerous enforcement actions.
156
  When the Commission reclassified broadband Internet access 
service as a common carriage telecommunications service in 2015, however, that action stripped FTC 
authority over Internet service providers because the FTC is prohibited from regulating common

carriers.
157
  To address the gap created by the Commission’s reclassification of broadband Internet access 
service as a common carriage service, the Title II Order called for a new rulemaking to apply section 
222’s customer proprietary network information provisions to Internet service providers.
158
  In October 
2016, the Commission adopted rules governing Internet service providers’ privacy practices and applied 
the rules it adopted to other providers of telecommunications services.
159
  In March 2017, Congress voted 
under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to disapprove the Commission’s 2016 Privacy Order, which 
prevents us from adopting rules in substantially the same form.
160
67. We propose to respect the jurisdictional lines drawn by Congress whereby the FTC 
oversees Internet service providers’ privacy practices, given its decades of experience and expertise in 
this area.
161
  We seek comment on this proposal.
68. Lifeline.  We propose to maintain support for broadband in the Lifeline program after 
reclassification.  In the Universal Service Transformation Order, the Commission recognized that 
“[s]ection 254 grants the Commission the authority to support not only voice telephony service but also 
the facilities over which it is offered”
162
and “allows us to . . . require carriers receiving federal universal 
service support to invest in modern broadband-capable networks.”
163
  Accordingly, as the Commission 
did in the Universal Service Transformation Order, we propose requiring Lifeline carriers to use Lifeline 
support “for the provision, maintenance, and upgrading” of broadband services and facilities capable of 
providing supported services.
164
  We seek comment on this proposal.  We also seek comment on any rule 
changes necessary to effectuate this change in our underlying authority to support broadband for low-
income individuals and families.
69. Other.  Beyond the issues raised above, we seek comment on the impact of 
reclassification on other Commission proceedings and proposals.  For instance, how should we take into 
                                                     
157
See 15 U.S.C. §§ 45(a)(2) (exempting “common carriers subject to the Acts to regulate commerce”), 44 (defining 
“Acts to regulate commerce” as including “the Communications Act of 1934 and all Acts amendatory thereof and 
supplementary thereto”); 47 U.S.C. § 153(51) (providing that “[a] telecommunications carrier shall be treated as a 
common carrier under [the Communications Act] only to the extent that it is engaged in providing 
telecommunications services”).  One Ninth Circuit case held that the common carrier exemption precluded FTC 
oversight of ISPs that otherwise were common carriers with respect to non ISP services.  See FTC v. AT&T Mobility 
LLC, 835 F.3d 993 (9th Cir. 2016), reh’g en banc granted, No. 15-16585, 2017 WL 1856836 (9th Cir. May 9, 
2017). As the FCC recently explained in that case, the panel decision erred by overlooking the textual relationship 
between the statutes governing the FTC’s and FCC’s jurisdiction.  See Letter Pursuant to Fed R. App. P 28(j) of 
amicus FCC, FTC v. AT&T Mobility LLC, No. 15-16585 (9th Cir. Apr. 21, 2017).   The FCC’s letter called on the 
Ninth Circuit to grant rehearing, which it recently did, and in doing so it set aside the earlier and erroneous panel 
opinion.  See Order, FTC v. AT&T Mobility, LLC, No. 15-16585 (9th Cir. May 9, 2017).  The recent en banc order 
by the Ninth Circuit means that the Title II Order’s reclassification of broadband Internet access service serves as 
the only limit on the authority of the FTC to oversee the conduct of Internet service providers.

with respect to preemption under Section 253 of the Act?
165
  How should the Broadband Deployment 
Advisory Committee factor in the reduced regulatory burdens and increased investment that we anticipate 
will flow from reclassification?
166
  More generally, if broadband Internet access service is classified as an 
interstate information service, how would that impact jurisdiction?  We encourage commenters to offer 
specific recommendations as to how we can leverage our proposed reclassification in other proceedings to 
further encourage broadband deployment to all Americans.
IV. A LIGHT-TOUCH REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
70. Proposing to restore broadband Internet access service to its long-established 
classification as an information service reflects our commitment to a free and open Internet.  Indeed, our 
lead proposal reaffirms the long-standing, bipartisan consensus begun in the Clinton Administration by 
restoring the Internet to the dynamic state that allowed it to flourish prior to the Title II Order.  To 
determine how to best honor our commitment to restoring the free and open Internet, we propose re-
evaluating the Commission’s existing rules and enforcement regime to analyze whether ex ante regulatory 
intervention in the market is necessary.  To the extent we decide to retain any of the Commission’s ex 
ante regulations, we seek comment on whether, and how, we should modify them, specifically 
considering different approaches such as self-governance or ex post enforcement that may effectuate our 
goals better than across-the-board rules.  Finally, we discuss the Commission’s legal authority to adopt 
rules governing Internet service provider practices.
A. Re-evaluating the Existing Rules and Enforcement Regime
71. Below, we explore the best method to restore the long-standing consensus under both 
Democratic and Republican-led Commissions, represented by the four Internet Freedoms, that consumers 
should have access to the content, applications, and devices of their choosing as well as meaningful 
information about their service, all without deterring the investment and innovation that has allowed the 
Internet to flourish.  We examine these freedoms and the Commission’s current rules related to them, and 
for each, ask whether we should keep, modify, or eliminate them.
1. Eliminating the Internet Conduct Standard
72. In the Title II Order, the Commission created a catch-all standard intended to prohibit 
“current or future practices that cause the type of harms [the Commission’s] rules are intended to 
address.”
167
  This standard allows the Commission to prohibit practices that it determines unreasonably 
interfere with or unreasonably disadvantage the ability of consumers to reach the Internet content, 
services, and applications of their choosing or of online content, applications, and service providers to 
access consumers.
168
  This standard also gives the Commission discretion to prohibit any Internet service 
provider practice that it believes violates any one of the non-exhaustive list of factors adopted in the Title 
II Order.

investment, or broadband deployment; free expression; application/use-agnostic; and standard practices).
Federal Communications Commission FCC 17-60
26
73. We propose eliminating this Internet conduct standard and the non-exhaustive list of 
factors intended to guide application of the rule, and we seek comment on this proposal.  What are the 
costs of the present Internet conduct standard and implementing factors?  Do the standard and its 
implementing factors provide carriers with adequate notice of what they are and are not allowed to do?
170
  
Does the standard benefit consumers in any way and, if so, how?  We believe that eliminating the Internet 
conduct standard will promote network investment and service-related innovation by eliminating the 
uncertainty caused by vague and undefined regulation.  Do commenters agree?
74. Because the Internet conduct standard is premised on theoretical problems that will be 
adjudicated on an individual, case-by-case basis, Internet service providers must guess at what they are 
permitted and not permitted to do.
171
  The now-retracted so-called Zero Rating Report issued by the 
Wireless Telecommunications Bureau illustrates the dilemma providers experience under a Title II 
regulatory regime.
172
  After a thirteen-month investigation, the Report did not specifically call for an end 
to any provider’s practices or identify any particular harm from offering consumers free data.  Instead, it 
stated that the free-data plans “may raise” economic and public policy issues that “may harm consumers 
and competition.”
173
  It then reiterated that any determination about the harm from free data offerings 
would be made by the Commission on a “case-by-case” basis, using a “non-exhaustive list of factors.”
174
  
Instead of giving providers clear rules of the road to govern future conduct, this report put a provider on 
notice that an enforcement action could be just around the corner.  The Report, and the investigation that 
preceded it, left Internet service providers with two options: either wait for a regulatory enforcement 
action that could arrive at some unspecified future point or stop providing consumers with innovative 
offerings.  We seek comment on whether this roving mandate has impacted innovation, and what impact 
that has had on consumers.  We seek comment on whether eliminating this vague standard will spur 
innovation and benefit consumers.
75. We propose not to adopt any alternatives to the Internet conduct rule, and we seek 
comment on this proposal.  Is there a need for any general non-discrimination standard in today’s Internet 
marketplace?  If so, what would that general non-discrimination standard be?  The 2014 Notice proposed 
prohibiting “commercially unreasonable practices.”
175
  Should we consider that alternative?  Or should 
we consider another general rule and framework (such as Commission adjudication of non-discrimination 
complaints)?  If we adopt our proposals to eliminate the Internet conduct standard and not to adopt any 
alternative general requirement, we seek comment on how we can encourage innovative business models 
that give consumers more choices and lower prices while also promoting consumer freedom on the 
Internet.

2. Determining the Need for the Bright Line Rules and the Transparency Rule
76. In the Title II Order, despite virtually no quantifiable evidence of consumer harm, the
Commission nevertheless determined that it needed bright line rules banning three specific practices by 
providers of both fixed and mobile broadband Internet access service: blocking, throttling, and paid 
prioritization.
176
  The Commission also “enhanced” the transparency rule by adopting additional 
disclosure requirements.
177
  Today, we revisit these determinations and seek comment on whether we 
should keep, modify, or eliminate the bright line and transparency rules.
77. At the outset of our review of the Commission’s existing rules, we seek comment on 
whether ex ante regulatory intervention in the market is necessary in the broadband context.  Beyond the 
few, scattered anecdotes cited by the Title II Order, have there been additional, concrete incidents that 
threaten the four Internet Freedoms sufficient to warrant adopting across-the-board rules?  Is there any 
evidence of market failure, or is there likely to be, sufficient to warrant pre-emptive, comprehensive 
regulation?  How have marketplace developments impacted the incentive and ability, if any, of broadband 
Internet access service providers to engage in conduct that is contrary to the four Internet Freedoms?  
Must we find that market power exists to retain rules in this space, and if so must the rules only apply to 
providers that have market power?  Further, should any approach we adopt —whether ex ante rules, 
expectations regarding industry self-governance, or ex post enforcement practices—vary based on the 
size, financial resources, customer base of the broadband Internet access service provider, and/or other 
factors?  Specifically, we seek comment on whether rules are necessary for or burdensome on smaller 
providers.
78. The Commission partially justified the 2015 rules on the theory that the rules would 
prevent anti-competitive behavior by ISPs seeking to advantage affiliated content.
178
  With the existence 
of antitrust regulations aimed at curbing various forms of anticompetitive conduct, such as collusion and 
vertical restraints under certain circumstances, we seek comment on whether these rules are necessary in 
light of these other regulatory regimes.
179
  Could the continued existence of these rules negatively impact 
future innovative, pro-competitive business deals that would not by themselves run afoul of merger 
conditions or established antitrust law?
79. In addition, the D.C. Circuit majority that reviewed the Title II Order stated that “[i]f a 
broadband provider . . . were to choose to exercise editorial discretion—for instance, by picking a limited 
set of websites to carry and offering that service as a curated internet experience,” then the Title II Order
“excludes such [a] provider[] from the rules.”
180
  Given that an ISP can avoid Title II classification simply 
by blocking enough content, are the purported benefits of the existing rules more illusory than they 
initially appear?  By disclosing to consumers that it is offering a “curated internet experience,” can an ISP

bandwidth for the competing over-the-top offering to prevent it from reaching the broadband provider’s end user in 
the same manner as the affiliated application.”). 
179
See generally 47 U.S.C. § 152(b) (“[N]othing in this Act . . . shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede

Division of the Department of Justice or the Commission itself from fulfilling their respective responsibilities under 
Section 7 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. §18), or the Commission’s public interest standard as it assesses prospective 
transactions.” See Title II Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 5606, para. 13 n.12.  See also Thomas W. Hazlett, and Joshua D.

escape from the ambit of the rules entirely?  We seek comment on the implications of the D.C. Circuit’s 
observation.  
80. Need for the No-Blocking Rule.  We emphasize that we oppose blocking lawful material.  
The Commission has repeatedly found the need for a no-blocking rule on principle, asserting that “the 
freedom to send and receive lawful content and to use and provide applications and services without fear 
of blocking is essential to the Internet’s openness.”
181
  We merely seek comment on the appropriate 
means to achieve this outcome consistent with the goals of maintaining Internet freedom, maximizing 
investment, and respecting the rule of law.  We seek comment on whether a codified no-blocking rule is 
needed to protect such freedoms.  For example, prior to 2015, many large Internet service providers 
voluntarily abided by the 2010 no-blocking rule in the absence of a regulatory obligation to do so.
182
  Do 
we have reason to think providers would behave differently today if the Commission were to eliminate 
the no-blocking rule?  Is the no-blocking rule necessary for or burdensome on smaller providers?
81. We seek comment on the continuing need for a no-blocking rule.  The no-blocking rule, 
originally adopted in 2010, invalidated by the Verizon court, and re-adopted in the Title II Order, 
prohibits Internet service providers from blocking competitors’ content by mandating that a customer has 
a right to access lawful content, applications, services, and to use non-harmful devices, subject to 
reasonable network management.
183
82. If we determine that a no-blocking rule is indeed necessary to ensure a free, open, and 
dynamic Internet, what are the best means to achieve this outcome consistent with the goals of 
maintaining Internet freedom and maximizing investment?  Should we consider modifying the existing 
no-blocking rule to better align with our proposed legal classification of broadband Internet access service 
as an information service?  The Verizon court made clear that the Commission’s 2010 no-blocking rule 
impermissibly subjected Internet service providers to common-carriage regulation.
184
  We seek comment 
on whether there are other formulations of a no-blocking rule that are consistent with our proposed legal 
classification of broadband Internet access service as an information service and for which we would have 
legal authority.
83. Need for the No-Throttling Rule.  In the Title II Order, the Commission concluded that 
throttling was a sufficiently severe and distinct threat that it required its own, separate, codified rule.
185
  
The no-throttling rule mirrors the no-blocking rule and bans the impairment or degradation of lawful 
Internet traffic or use of a non-harmful device, subject to reasonable network management practices.
186
  
We seek comment on whether this rule is still necessary, particularly for smaller providers.  How does the 
rule benefit consumers, and what are its costs?  When is “throttling” harmful to consumers?  Does the no-
throttling rule prevent providers from offering broadband Internet access service with differentiated 
prioritization that benefits consumers?  Does the no-throttling rule harm latency-sensitive applications and 
content?  Does it prevent product differentiation among ISPs?  If we eliminate the no-blocking rule,

should we also eliminate the no-throttling rule?  If we determine that a no-throttling rule is indeed 
necessary to ensure a free, open, and dynamic Internet, are there ways in which we could modify the no-
throttling rule so it aligns with our proposed legal classification of broadband Internet access service as an 
information service and for which we would have legal authority?  
84. The Commission justified the separate, codified no-throttling rule on the theory of 
preventing anti-competitive behavior for broadband Internet access providers’ affiliated content.
187
  With 
the existence of antitrust and other regulations aimed at curbing collusion, we seek comment on whether a 
no-throttling rule is duplicative of these other regulatory regimes.
188
  Could the continued existence of this 
rule negatively impact future innovative, pro-competitive business deals that would not by themselves run 
afoul of merger conditions or established antitrust law?
85. Need for the No Paid Prioritization Rule.  The Commission concluded in the Title II 
Order that “fast lanes” or “paid prioritization” practices “harm consumers, competition, and innovation, 
as well as create disincentives to promote broadband deployment.”
189
  The Commission adopted this ex
ante flat ban on individual negotiations to address an apparently nonexistent problem.  The ban on paid 
prioritization did not exist prior to the Title II Order and even then the record evidence confirmed that no 
such rule was needed since several large Internet service providers made it clear that that they did not 
engage in paid prioritization
190
and had no plans to do so.
191
  We seek comment on the continued need for 
such a rule and our authority to retain it.
86. What are the trade-offs in banning business models dependent on paid prioritization 
versus allowing them to occur when overseen by a regulator or industry actors?  Is there a risk that 
banning paid prioritization suppresses pro-competitive activity?  For example, could allowing paid 
prioritization give Internet service providers a supplemental revenue stream that would enable them to 
offer lower-priced broadband Internet access service to end-users?  What would be the impacts on new 
startups and innovation?  Does a no-paid-prioritization rule harm the development of real-time or 
interactive services?
192
  Could allowing paid prioritization enable certain critical information, such as 
consumers’ health care vital signs that are being monitored remotely, to be transmitted more efficiently or 
reliably?  What other considerations mitigate any potential negative impacts from business models like 
paid prioritization?  Should the Commission impose restrictions on these business models at all?
87. We seek comment on current traffic delivery arrangements online.  How do content, 
application, and service providers host their data online?  Do they rely on installing their own servers in 
data centers, content delivery networks, or cloud-based hosting?  What are the varying service 
characteristics of these options and their varying costs?  It appears that some larger online content 
providers like Netflix host their own data centers and interconnect directly with Internet service 
providers.
193
  Is that still true?  What are the service characteristics and costs of this option?  How should 
the existence of these arrangement impact our evaluation of whether Internet service providers should be 
able to offer an alternative delivery option such paid prioritization?

88. For those parties that believe an ex ante flat ban on paid prioritization is necessary, are 
there other formulations of a no-paid-prioritization rule that are consistent with our proposed legal 
classification of broadband Internet access service as an information service and for which we would have 
legal authority?  Are there any other formulations that are consistent with allowing pro-competitive or 
pro-consumer paid prioritization arrangements?  Would we need to modify the rule and, if so, how?
89. Need for the Transparency Rule.  We seek comment on whether to keep, modify, or 
eliminate the transparency rule.
194
  When the Commission adopted the transparency rule in 2010 and 
enhanced it in 2015, it found that “effective disclosure of Internet service providers’ network management 
practices, performance, and commercial terms of service promotes competition, innovation, investment, 
end-user choice, and broadband adoption.”
195
  We continue to support these objectives and seek comment 
on whether the existing transparency rule is the best way to accomplish them, or if there are other 
methods we can employ to achieve the goals of competition, innovation, investment, end-user choice, and 
broadband adoption.
90. Although we agree that the disclosure requirements were among some of the least 
intrusive regulatory measures imposed by the Title II Order,
196
we seek comment on whether the 
additional reporting obligations from that rule remains necessary in today’s competitive broadband 
marketplace.  What are the benefits and drawbacks of those additional reporting obligations?  Is the 
length of time necessary to obtain approval of these rules, first adopted in February 2015 and yet not 
going into effect until nearly two years later, illustrative of just how burdensome the new enhancements 
are in comparison to the 2010 rule?
197
  Would the original transparency rule, which has been continuously 
operational since it came into effect following adoption of the Open Internet Order, be sufficient to 
protect consumers?  Although the Verizon court upheld the 2010 transparency rule, we seek comment on 
our authority to retain the 2015 “enhancements” or to modify the transparency rule in a manner distinct 
from the Open Internet Order or Title II Order.  For example, does the full and accurate disclosure of 
service plan information to consumers carry with it most of the benefits of the rule?  How often do non-
consumers rely on the additional disclosures required by the transparency rule?  Are those additional 
benefits worth the additional cost of compliance, especially for small businesses?
91. Assuming we find a transparency rule necessary, how should we treat the additional 
guidance related to the transparency rule?  For example, should we continue to enforce guidance from the 
Commission’s Chief Technology Officer regarding acceptable methodologies for disclosure of network 
performance to satisfy the enhanced transparency rule?
198
  Is there merit in continuing to promote the 
broadband consumer labels that provided ISPs with a safe harbor—or do those standardized notices harm 
consumers by preventing them from obtaining additional information?
199
  Does the repeated need for

ended?
200
3. Additional Considerations Applicable to Existing Rules
92. Should we decide to keep or modify any of our existing open Internet rules, we propose 
and seek comment on several issues related to their continued operation.  
93. Scope.  Should we keep any of the existing bright-line rules or the transparency rule, we 
propose maintaining the definitions of the services applicable to the rules, the scope of the term “lawful 
content,” the exception for reasonable network management, and other provisions adopted in the Title II 
Order so as not to impact ISPs rights or obligations with respect to other laws or safety and security 
considerations.
201
  Reasonable network management “allow[s] service providers the freedom to address 
legitimate needs such as avoiding network congestion and combating harmful or illegal content” without 
running afoul of the rules.
202
  With respect to the definition of “reasonable network management,” we 
seek comment on whether we should eliminate the restriction imposed by the Title II Order that the
exception will only be considered if used for a “technical management justification rather than other 
business justifications,”
203
or if we should return to the 2010 definition of “reasonable network 
management” that did not contain that qualifier.
204
  
94. For the reasonable network management exception and definition of non-broadband 
Internet access service data services that fall outside the scope of the rules, we seek comment on how we 
should view any additional guidance explaining those terms as set forth in the Title II Order, but not 
codified as part of the rules.
205
  Should we follow the case-by-case approach taken for evaluating 
reasonable network management?
206
  For non-broadband Internet access service data services, should we 
adhere to the characteristics of non-broadband Internet access service data services described in the Title 
II Order?
207
  Or, should we revert to the general concept of non-broadband Internet access service data

32
services discussed in the Open Internet Order (and then known as “specialized services”)?  Further, for 
non-broadband Internet access service data services, should we eliminate the guidance that if non-
broadband Internet access service data services “are undermining investment, innovation, competition, 
and end-user benefits,” then the Commission will take enforcement action—including the particularized 
focus on ensuring that “over-the-top services offered over the Internet are not impeded in their ability to 
compete with other data services?”
208
95. Application to Mobile.  To the extent we keep or modify any of the existing rules, we 
seek comment on whether mobile broadband should be treated differently from fixed broadband.  The 
Title II Order applied the Internet openness rules equally to both fixed and mobile broadband Internet 
access services.
209
  This approach departed from the Open Internet Order’s framework, which adopted a 
different no-blocking standard for mobile broadband Internet access service and excluded mobile from 
the no unreasonable discrimination rule.
210
  Are there legal, technical, economic, and/or policy reasons to 
distinguish mobile and fixed broadband with respect to rules in this context, and if so how should we 
differentiate the two in any rules that we keep or modify?  For instance, several mobile providers who 
opposed application of the broader rules in 2015 argued that additional rules were unnecessary because 
competition for mobile broadband service adequately restrained the behavior of mobile Internet service 
providers.
211
  We seek comment on whether this contention is correct in today’s marketplace.  
4. Enforcement Regime 
96. Should we keep or modify any of the Commission’s existing rules discussed above, we 
seek comment on how we should enforce them.  In the Open Internet Order the Commission set forth 
procedures for filing both informal
212
and formal
213
complaints.  Commission rules currently provide for 
filing fees in the case of complaints to enforce Part 8 rules governing broadband Internet access service 
and in the case of data roaming complaints.
214
  Would those rules need to be modified in the event that we 
reclassify broadband Internet access service?  Could some rules subject to those complaint procedures 
remain?  Are there other similar issues the Commission would need to address?  The Title II Order also 
allowed the Enforcement Bureau to issue advisory opinions
215
and enforcement advisories,
216
and it 
created an ombudsperson position to provide effective access to dispute resolution.
217
  We seek comment 
on whether advisory opinions or enforcement advisories have benefitted consumers or broadband Internet 
access service providers.  If we restore the broadband Internet access service classification to an 
information service, should that alter our complaint and enforcement process in this context?
(Continued from previous page)                                                            
reach large parts of the Internet, not a generic platform—but rather a specific “application level” service, and use 
some form of network management to isolate the capacity used by these services from that used by broadband 
Internet access services).

97. Additionally, we seek comment on streamlining future enforcement processes.  For 
instance, we propose eliminating the ombudsperson role.  Is the role of an ombudsperson necessary to 
protect consumer, business, and other organizations’ interests when the Commission has a Bureau—the 
Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau (CGB)—dedicated to protecting consumer interests?
218
  Our 
experience suggests that consumers are comfortable working with CGB, and typically did not call on the 
ombudsperson specifically.  Has the ombudsperson been called to action to assist in circumstances that 
otherwise could not have been handled by CGB?
98. What have been the benefits and drawbacks of the complaint procedures instituted in 
2010 and 2015?  Since these rules were formally codified in 2010, only one formal complaint has been 
filed under them to date.
219
  Can we infer that parties heeded the Commission’s encouragement to 
“resolve disputes through informal discussions and private negotiations” without Commission 
involvement, except through the informal complaint process?
220
  Does the lack of formal complaints 
indicate that dedicated, formal enforcement procedures are unwarranted?  If we restore broadband 
Internet access service’s classification as an information service, should that alter our complaint and 
enforcement process in this context?  If so, in what way should the processes be altered?  Are there 
methods other than formal complaints we can employ to ensure a free and open Internet?
99. In addition to the enforcement regime, the Title II Order delegated authority to several 
Bureaus and Offices to make further decisions involving the rules following their adoption.  For example, 
the Title II Order delegated authority to the Chief Technologist to provide guidance under the 
transparency rule and further delegated authority to several Bureaus to determine whether the safe harbor 
disclosures under the transparency rule aligned with the Commission’s expectations.
221
  If we determine 
there is no need for the existing transparency rule or enforcement regime, then we believe that the 
technological and safe harbor guidance would become irrelevant.  We also believe that the safe harbor 
disclosure guidance would be rendered moot.  We seek comment on this analysis and on whether there 
nonetheless are any affirmative steps the Commission should take with respect either to those delegations 
of authority or to actions already taken in reliance on that delegated authority.
B. Legal Authority to Adopt Rules
100. We seek comment on the legal authority that the Commission would have in this area if 
we adopted our lead proposal to classify broadband Internet access service as an information service.
101. Section 706.  We seek comment on whether section 706(a) and (b) of the 1996 Act are 
best interpreted as hortatory rather than as delegations of regulatory authority.  Such an interpretation 
generally is reflected in the Commission’s approach to section 706 prior to 2010.
222
  The text of these 
provisions also appears more naturally read as hortatory, particularly given the lack of any express grant 
of rulemaking authority, authority to prescribe or proscribe the conduct of any party, or to enforce 
compliance.  Although some courts have held that the Commission’s post-2010 interpretation of section 
706(a) and/or (b) as a grant of regulatory authority was not unreasonable, we seek comment on whether 
interpreting those provisions as hortatory nonetheless is the better reading.
223
  Or should we maintain our

post-2010 interpretation of these provisions?  Alternatively, we seek comment whether section 706 
reflects a “deregulatory bent,”
224
and, if so, how we should interpret that with respect to obligations for 
regulated entities.  If section 706 reflects a deregulatory emphasis, what authority does it give the 
Commission, particularly in situations in which capital expenditures by Internet service providers have 
slowed, as they have in the past year under Title II regulation?  If we interpret section 706(a) as a grant of 
authority, does that mean state commissions would have coequal authority?  If we interpret section 706(b) 
as a grant of authority, what would happen to any rules adopted using that authority if the Commission 
later found that advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a 
reasonable and timely fashion?  Are there other interpretations of section 706 of the 1996 Act that we 
should consider?
102. Section 230.  We also seek comment on whether section 230 gives us the authority to 
retain any rules that were adopted in the Title II Order.  In Comcast, the D.C. Circuit observed that the 
Commission there “acknowledge[d] that section 230(b)” is a “statement [] of policy that [itself] 
delegate[s] no regulatory authority.”
225
  Are there grounds for the Commission to revisit that 
interpretation or otherwise invoke section 230 here?  For example, the D.C. Circuit in Comcast speculated 
that “[p]erhaps the Commission could use section 230(b) . . . to demonstrate . . . a connection” to an 
“express statutory delegation of authority,” although it had not done so there.
226
  If the Commission were 
to demonstrate a connection to an express statutory delegation of authority, what would such a 
demonstration look like?  What, if any, express statutory delegations of authority over broadband Internet 
access service exist?
103. Other Sources of Legal Authority.  Should we determine rules are indeed necessary in 
this space, we seek comment on any other sources of independent legal authority we might use to support 
such rules.  For example, we seek comment on the Communications Act authority cited by the 
Commission in its Open Internet Order.
227
  If any other sources of legal authority exist, to what extent 
could they be used?  And, what are the trade-offs, including the advantages and disadvantages, of using 
any of these other sources of legal authority in lieu of Title II provisions that depend on the classification 
of broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service and/or section 706 of the 1996 Act?
104. Constraints on our Legal Authority.  The Commission has repeatedly recognized that 
adopting rules like these raises constitutional concerns.
228
  For example, some petitioners in the 
USTelecom v. FCC case argued that compelling an Internet service provider to carry all speech violates 
the First Amendment.
229
  Others have argued that “[t]here is no principled basis for distinguishing the

Cir. 2014) (rejecting arguments that it was unreasonable for the Commission to interpret Section 706(b) as granting 
regulatory authority); USTelecom, 825 F.3d at 733–34 (reaffirming the holding in Verizon regarding Section 706).

speech of broadband providers from other speakers using older technologies.”
230
  The D.C. Circuit Court 
of Appeals disagreed, finding that “the First Amendment poses no bar to the rules.”
231
  However, at least 
one judge on the D.C. Circuit believes that the Commission’s current “net neutrality rule violates the First 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. . . . [because] the First Amendment bars the Government from 
restricting the editorial discretion of Internet service providers, absent a showing that an Internet service 
provider possesses market power in a relevant geographic market.”
232
  We seek comment on whether the 
First Amendment or any other constitutional provision, or any other federal law, would constrain the 
Commission from adopting rules here.  If a rule poses serious constitutional concerns, how should we 
modify it?  Does the continued classification of broadband Internet access service as a common-carriage 
service itself raise any constitutional concerns?
C. Cost-Benefit Analysis
105. We propose as part of this proceeding to conduct a cost-benefit analysis (CBA).  We 
propose to compare the costs and the benefits of maintaining the classification of broadband Internet 
access service as a telecommunications service (i.e. Title II regulation);
233
maintaining the Internet 
conduct rule; maintaining the no-blocking rule; maintaining the no-throttling rule; maintaining the ban on 
paid prioritization; maintaining the transparency rules; and acting on the other interpretive and policy 
changes for which we seek comment above.  We seek comment on how the CBA should be conducted to 
appropriately separate or combine the analyses of each piece discussed above.  We also seek comment 
generally on the importance of conducting a CBA as well as the interaction between the Commission’s 
public interest standard and a weighing of the costs and benefits.
106. Given the size of the economic impacts due to our decisions in this proceeding, it is 
especially important to evaluate whether the decision will have net positive benefits.  Our presumption is 
that the effects of the decision would have an annual effect on the economy of at least $100 million which 
is the federal government’s standard threshold for requiring agencies covered by Executive Order 12866 
to conduct a regulatory analysis.
234
  Executive Order 12866 indicates regulatory actions are economically 
significant if they “[h]ave an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in 
a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, 
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities.”
235
  While the Commission 
is not required by law to comply with this Executive Order, we believe the $100 million threshold

2017) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc).
233
Throughout this section, when discussing maintaining broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications
service, we mean as actually implemented by the Title II Order, where the Commission forbore from applying some 
sections of the Act and some Commission rules.
234
A “regulatory analysis” has three key components: (1) a statement of the need for a proposed action, (2) an 
examination of alternative approaches, and (3) an evaluation of the benefits and the costs.  See Office of 
Management and Budget, Circular A-4, https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/circulars_a004_a-4/#a (last 
visited May 19, 2017) (Circular A-4).  The other parts of this Notice effectively seek comment on the first and 
second pieces of the regulatory analysis.
235
For entities covered by Executive Order 12866, regulatory actions deemed economically significant must 
undergo review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and this review will typically require 
an accounting of the costs and benefits. See Exec. Order No. 12,866, 58 Fed. Reg. 51735 (Sep. 30, 1993);

provides a helpful guideline for when a CBA is clearly appropriate.
236
  We seek comment on our assertion 
that conducting a CBA is appropriate and that the decision is likely to be economically significant.
107. In conducting the CBA, we propose to follow standard practices employed by the federal 
government.  Specifically we propose to follow the guidelines in Section E (“Identifying and Measuring 
Benefits and Costs”) of the Office of Management and Budget’s Circular A-4.
237
  This publication 
provides guidelines that an agency can follow for identifying and quantifying costs and benefits 
associated with regulatory decisions while allowing for appropriate latitude in how the analysis is 
conducted for a particular regulatory situation.  We seek comment on following Circular A-4 generally.  
We also seek comment on any specific portions of Circular A-4 where the Commission should diverge 
from the guidance provided.  Commenters should explain why particular guidance in Circular A-4 should 
not be followed in this circumstance and should propose alternatives.
108. Any CBA should be conducted by comparing the costs and benefits relative to the 
“baseline” scenario.  As OMB Circular A-4 explains, “[t]his baseline should be the best assessment of the 
way the world would look absent the proposed action.”  Care should be taken to recognize that in certain 
cases repealing or eliminating a rule does not result in a total lack of regulation but instead means that 
other regulations continue to operate or other regulatory bodies will have authority.  For example, as we 
evaluate the costs and benefits of maintaining the current classification of broadband Internet access 
service as a telecommunications service, the CBA should recognize that changing the classification of 
broadband Internet access service to an information service would result in the FTC having jurisdiction 
over certain aspects of such services.  Therefore, the benefits and costs of the FCC maintaining Title II 
jurisdiction over broadband Internet access service should be calculated with FTC enforcement as the 
appropriate baseline.  In this example, the benefits of maintaining the Commission’s Title II classification 
are those benefits that exist over and above the “baseline” scenario of FTC jurisdiction (and, at a 
minimum, FCC Title I protections).  Likewise, the costs of maintaining Title II should be estimated as 
those costs of ex ante FCC regulation relative to FTC ex post regulation.  We seek comment on the 
appropriate baseline scenarios that should be used and on our proposed course of action above.
109. In weighing the costs and benefits of any policy, there always exists an element of 
uncertainty.  As commenters suggest costs and benefits the Commission should consider, we ask that to 
the extent possible information could also be provided about the level of certainty surrounding a scenario 
or particular value.  Also, various costs and benefits are likely to occur at different points in time.  When 
suggesting costs and benefits, we seek comment on the timing of those costs and benefits.
238
  We also 
seek comment on how uncertainty around and timing of costs and benefits should interact in the analysis.
110. Costs.  There is evidence that the actions taken by the Commission in the Title II Order
have reduced investments by ISPs.
239
  We presume that maintaining those actions would depress 
investment relative to the baseline.  Many of the costs of lower or misallocated investment in networks 
and in other sectors of the digital economy will be due to consumers and businesses having less 
broadband Internet access service coverage and lower quality of service.  Since the networks built with 
capital investments are only a means to an end, we believe that the private costs borne by consumers and 
businesses of maintaining the status quo result from decreased value derived from using the networks.  
We seek comment on this analysis.  What approaches should we use to capture these costs?  We seek 
                                                     
236
While we believe it is clearly appropriate for actions in excess of $100 million, we make no suggestion here 
about whether the Commission should conduct CBAs below that threshold.
237
Circular A-4, Section E https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/circulars_a004_a-4/#e.
238
As explained in OMB Circular A-4, Section E, the timing of costs and benefits is important because ultimately 
the CBA will need to discount future costs and benefits for the purpose of calculating net present benefits.
239
See, e.g., Hal Singer, 2016 Broadband Capex Survey: Tracking Investment in the Title II Era (Mar. 1, 2016),

Federal Communications Commission FCC 17-60

comment on particular methods and data sources we might use to estimate the private costs of forgoing 
the building, maintaining, or upgrading of these networks.
111. In addition to the private costs discussed above, foregone networks may also impose 
additional societal costs.  In particular, fewer network effects created by increased connectivity will 
occur. As another example, society will not realize some efficiencies and savings from governments 
delivering services over the networks.  Additionally, there are likely long run costs due to forgoing better 
connectivity that would allow new products and services to be created.  We seek comment on this 
analysis.  How should our CBA incorporate these types of cost into the analysis?  What other ancillary 
costs might exist?  What data is appropriate to use?
112. It is also likely that the foregone investment per se results in economic costs (e.g., fewer 
network construction jobs), and we seek comment on how the Commission should incorporate any of
these costs into the analysis.  For example, should the Commission use a multiplier to account for 
economic activity missed due to tempered investment?  If so, what are the appropriate multipliers to use?  
Commenters should provide sources to justify recommendations for multiplier values.
113. Lastly, there may be other costs that are not directly the result of decreased investment in 
networks.  Maintaining current policies may prevent new business models or new products and services 
from being viable and ultimately delivering value to society.  We seek comment on such costs and how 
we may incorporate them into our analysis.  
114. Benefits.  There are various theoretical possibilities for economic benefits created by the 
current policies.  We therefore seek comment on these benefits.  Commenters should identify these 
benefits relative to an appropriate baseline, not relative to a situation where there is no regulation or 
statute to govern behavior.  For example, if the ban on paid prioritization is maintained but broadband 
Internet access service is classified as an information service, then commenters should identify the 
benefits a blanket ban on paid prioritization carries over the FTC’s authority to police anticompetitive 
conduct.
115. We particularly seek comments that attempt to quantify the benefits rather than merely 
suggest the existence of benefits without any indication of their magnitude.  We also ask commenters to 
particularly highlight benefits where actual misconduct has been observed.  To the extent the baseline 
scenario allows any market failures to go unregulated, commenters should clearly identify the market 
failure and the estimated economic benefit associated with addressing it through the maintenance of 
current policies.
V. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
A. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
116. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA),
240
the Commission has 
prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) for this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, of the 
possible significant economic impact on small entities of the policies and rules addressed in this 
document.  The IRFA is set forth in Appendix B.  Written public comments are requested on this IRFA.  
Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed on or before the dates on the 
first page of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.  The Commission’s Consumer and Governmental 
Affairs Bureau, Reference Information Center, will send a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 
including the IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA).

B. Initial Paperwork Reduction Act Analysis
117. This document contains proposed modified information collection requirements. The 
Commission, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork burdens, invites the general public and 
the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) to comment on the information collection requirements 
contained in this document, as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Public Law 104-13.  In 
addition, pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44 
U.S.C. § 3506(c)(4), we seek specific comment on how we might further reduce the information 
collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees.
118. This document does not contain proposed information collection(s) subject to the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), Public Law 104-13.  In addition, therefore, it does not contain 
any new or modified information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 
employees, pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107-198, see 44 
U.S.C. 3506(c)(4).  
C. Other Procedural Matters

presenter may provide citations to such data or arguments in his or her prior comments, memoranda, or 
other filings (specifying the relevant page and/or paragraph numbers where such data or arguments can be 
found) in lieu of summarizing them in the memorandum.  Documents shown or given to Commission 
staff during ex parte meetings are deemed to be written ex parte presentations and must be filed 
consistent with rule 1.1206(b).  In proceedings governed by rule 1.49(f) or for which the Commission has 
made available a method of electronic filing, written ex parte presentations and memoranda summarizing 
oral ex parte presentations, and all attachments thereto, must be filed through the electronic comment 
filing system available for that proceeding, and must be filed in their native format (e.g., .doc, .xml, .ppt,

APPENDIX B
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
1. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),
1
the 
Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) of the possible significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities from the policies and rules proposed in this 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Notice).  The Commission requests written public comment on this 
IRFA.  Comments must be identified as responses to the IRFA and must be filed by the deadlines for 
comments on the Notice provided on the first page of the Notice.  The Commission will send a copy of 
the Notice, including this IRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration 
(SBA).
2
  In addition, the Notice and IRFA (or summaries thereof) will be published in the Federal 
Register.
3
A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Rules 
2. With this Notice, the Commission initiates a new rulemaking that proposes to restore the 
market-based policies necessary to preserve the future of Internet Freedom, and to reverse the decline in 
infrastructure investment, innovation, and options for American consumers put into motion by the 
Commission in 2015.  The Commission’s Title II Order has put at risk online investment and innovation, 
threatening the very open Internet it purported to preserve.  Investment in broadband networks declined.  
Internet service providers (ISPs) have pulled back on plans to deploy new and upgraded infrastructure and 
services to consumers.  This is particularly true of the smallest Internet service providers that serve 
consumers in rural, low-income, and other underserved communities.  This rulemaking continues the 
critical work to promote broadband deployment to rural consumers and infrastructure investment 
throughout our nation, to brighten the future of innovation both within networks and at their edge, and to 
close the digital divide.
3. The Notice sets forth the following three main proposals:  returning broadband Internet 
access service to its previously-settled classification as an information service, restoring the definition of 
“public switched telephone network” to its original meaning, and eliminating the Internet conduct 
standard.  The Notice also seeks comment on a variety of issues relating to the effects of the 
Commission’s Title II Order, including the burdens imposed by the Title II Order that have led to 
decreased investment and reduced innovation and have been felt by Internet service providers (ISPs) and 
consumers.  Additionally, the Notice seeks comment on the effects of reclassifying broadband Internet 
access service as an information service on the existing enforcement regime and the necessity of the other 
rules adopted in the Title II Order.  Specifically, the Notice seeks comment on the usefulness and 
necessity of the no-blocking rule, the no-throttling rule, the no paid prioritization rule, and the 
transparency rule. 
B. Legal Basis
4. The legal basis for any action that may be taken pursuant to the Notice is contained in 
sections 3, 10, 201(b), 230, 254(e), 303(r), 332, of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and 
section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 153, 160, 201(b), 254(e), 
303(r), 332, 1302.

C. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Rules 
Would Apply
5. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of, and where feasible, an estimate of 
the number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.
4
  The RFA generally 
defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small 
organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.”
5
  In addition, the term “small business” has the 
same meaning as the term “small-business concern” under the Small Business Act.
6
  A small-business 
concern” is one which:  (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of 
operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.
7
1. Total Small Entities 
6. Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions.  Our actions, 
over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present.  We therefore describe here, 
at the outset, three comprehensive small entity size standards that could be directly affected herein.
8
  First, 
while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory 
flexibility analysis, according to data from the SBA’s Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is 
an independent business having fewer than 500 employees.
9
  These types of small businesses represent 
99.9% of all businesses in the United States which translates to 28.8 million businesses.
10
  Next, the type 
of small entity described as a “small organization” is generally “any not-for-profit enterprise which is 
independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.”
11
  Nationwide, as of 2007, there were 
approximately 1,621,215 small organizations.
12
  Finally, the small entity described as a “small 
governmental jurisdiction” is defined generally as “governments of cities, towns, townships, villages, 
school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.”
13
  U.S. Census Bureau 
data published in 2012 indicate that there were 89,476 local governmental jurisdictions in the United 
States.
14
  We estimate that, of this total, as many as 88,761 entities may qualify as “small governmental 
jurisdictions.”
15
  Thus, we estimate that most governmental jurisdictions are small.

See 5 U.S.C. § 601(6).
6
See 5 U.S.C. § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of “small-business concern” in the Small Business 
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 632).  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 601(3), the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an 
agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity 
for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the 
agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.”

The 2012 U.S. Census Bureau data for small governmental organizations are not presented based on the size of 
the population in each organization. There were 89,476 local governmental organizations in the Census Bureau data 
for 2012, which is based on 2007 data.  As a basis of estimating how many of these 89,476 local government

2. Broadband Internet Access Service Providers
7. The proposed rules would apply to broadband Internet access service providers.  The 
Economic Census places these firms, whose services might include Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), 
in either of two categories, depending on whether the service is provided over the provider’s own 
telecommunications facilities (e.g., cable and DSL ISPs), or over client-supplied telecommunications 
connections (e.g., dial-up ISPs).  The former are within the category of Wired Telecommunications 
Carriers,
16
which has an SBA small business size standard of 1,500 or fewer employees.
17
  These are also 
labeled “broadband.”  The latter are within the category of All Other Telecommunications,
18
which has a 
size standard of annual receipts of $32.5 million or less.
19
  These are labeled non-broadband.  Census data 
for 2012 show that there were 3,117 firms that operated that year.  Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer 
than 1,000 employees.
20
  For the second category, census data for 2012 show that there were 1,442 firms 
that operated for the entire year Of those firms, a total of 1,400 had annual receipts less than $25 
million.
21
  Consequently, we estimate that the majority of broadband Internet access service provider 
firms are small entities. 
8. The broadband Internet access service provider industry has changed since this definition 
was introduced in 2007.  The data cited above may therefore include entities that no longer provide 
broadband Internet access service, and may exclude entities that now provide such service.  To ensure that 
this IRFA describes the universe of small entities that our action might affect, we discuss in turn several 
different types of entities that might be providing broadband Internet access service.  We note that, 
although we have no specific information on the number of small entities that provide broadband Internet 
access service over unlicensed spectrum, we include these entities in our Initial Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis.
3. Wireline Providers
9. Wired Telecommunications Carriers.  The U.S. Census Bureau defines this industry as 
“establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to transmission facilities and 
infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using 
wired communications networks.  Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a 
combination of technologies.  Establishments in this industry use the wired telecommunications network 
facilities that they operate to provide a variety of services, such as wired telephony services, including 
(Continued from previous page)                                                            
organizations were small, we note that there were a total of 715 cities and towns (incorporated places and minor 
civil divisions) with populations over 50,000 in 2011.  See U.S. Census Bureau, City and Town Totals Vintage: 
2011, http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2011/index.html.  If we subtract the 715 cities and towns that 
meet or exceed the 50,000 population threshold, we conclude that approximately 88,761 are small.

VoIP services, wired (cable) audio and video programming distribution, and wired broadband internet 
services.  By exception, establishments providing satellite television distribution services using facilities 
and infrastructure that they operate are included in this industry.”
22
  The SBA has developed a small 
business size standard for Wired Telecommunications Carriers, which consists of all such companies 
having 1,500 or fewer employees.
23
  Census data for 2012 show that there were 3,117 firms that operated 
that year.  Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.
24
  Thus, under this size standard, 
the majority of firms in this industry can be considered small.
10. Local Exchange Carriers (LECs).  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a 
size standard for small businesses specifically applicable to local exchange services.  The closest 
applicable NAICS Code category is Wired Telecommunications Carriers as defined above.  Under the 
applicable SBA size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.
25
  According to 
Commission data, census data for 2012 shows that there were 3,117 firms that operated that year.  Of this 
total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.
26
  The Commission therefore estimates that most 
providers of local exchange carrier service are small entities that may be affected by the rules adopted.
11. Incumbent LECs.  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a small business 
size standard specifically for incumbent local exchange services.  The closest applicable NAICS Code 
category is Wired Telecommunications Carriers as defined above.  Under that size standard, such a 
business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.
27
  According to Commission data, 3,117 firms 
operated in that year.  Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.
28
  Consequently, the 
Commission estimates that most providers of incumbent local exchange service are small businesses that 
may be affected by the rules and policies adopted.  Three hundred and seven (307) Incumbent Local 
Exchange Carriers reported that they were incumbent local exchange service providers.
29
  Of this total, an 
estimated 1,006 have 1,500 or fewer employees.
30
    
12. Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (Competitive LECs), Competitive Access Providers 
(CAPs), Shared-Tenant Service Providers, and Other Local Service Providers.  Neither the Commission 
nor the SBA has developed a small business size standard specifically for these service providers.  The 
appropriate NAICS Code category is Wired Telecommunications Carriers, as defined above.  Under that 
size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.31  U.S. Census data for 2012 
indicate that 3,117 firms operated during that year.  Of that number, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 
employees.
32
  Based on this data, the Commission concludes that the majority of Competitive LECS,

45
CAPs, Shared-Tenant Service Providers, and Other Local Service Providers, are small entities.  
According to Commission data, 1,442 carriers reported that they were engaged in the provision of either 
competitive local exchange services or competitive access provider services.
33
  Of these 1,442 carriers, an 
estimated 1,256 have 1,500 or fewer employees.
34
  In addition, 17 carriers have reported that they are 
Shared-Tenant Service Providers, and all 17 are estimated to have 1,500 or fewer employees.35  Also, 72 
carriers have reported that they are Other Local Service Providers.36   Of this total, 70 have 1,500 or 
fewer employees.37  Consequently, based on internally researched FCC data, the Commission estimates 
that most providers of competitive local exchange service, competitive access providers, Shared-Tenant 
Service Providers, and Other Local Service Providers are small entities.
13. We have included small incumbent LECs in this present RFA analysis.  As noted above, 
a “small business” under the RFA is one that, inter alia, meets the pertinent small business size standard 
(e.g., a telephone communications business having 1,500 or fewer employees), and “is not dominant in its 
field of operation.”
38
  The SBA’s Office of Advocacy contends that, for RFA purposes, small incumbent 
LECs are not dominant in their field of operation because any such dominance is not “national” in 
scope.
39
  We have therefore included small incumbent LECs in this RFA analysis, although we emphasize 
that this RFA action has no effect on Commission analyses and determinations in other, non-RFA 
contexts.
14. Interexchange Carriers (IXCs).  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a 
definition for Interexchange Carriers.  The closest NAICS Code category is Wired Telecommunications 
Carriers as defined above.  The applicable size standard under SBA rules is that such a business is small if 
it has 1,500 or fewer employees.40  U.S. Census data for 2012 indicates that 3,117 firms operated during 
that year.  Of that number, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.
41
  According to internally 
developed Commission data, 359 companies reported that their primary telecommunications service 
activity was the provision of interexchange services.
42
  Of this total, an estimated 317 have 1,500 or fewer 
employees.
43
  Consequently, the Commission estimates that the majority of IXCs are small entities that 
may be affected by our proposed rules.
15. Operator Service Providers (OSPs).  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed 
a small business size standard specifically for operator service providers.  The appropriate size standard 
under SBA rules is for the category Wired Telecommunications Carriers.  Under that size standard, such a

39
Letter from Jere W. Glover, Chief Counsel for Advocacy, SBA, to William E. Kennard, Chairman, Federal 
Communications Commission (filed May 27, 1999).  The Small Business Act contains a definition of “small 
business concern,” which the RFA incorporates into its own definition of “small business.”  15 U.S.C. § 632(a); 5 
U.S.C. § 601(3).  SBA regulations interpret “small business concern” to include the concept of dominance on a 
national basis.  13 CFR § 121.102(b).

business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.
44
  According to Commission data, 33 carriers have 
reported that they are engaged in the provision of operator services.  Of these, an estimated 31 have 1,500 
or fewer employees and two have more than 1,500 employees.
45
  Consequently, the Commission 
estimates that the majority of OSPs are small entities that may be affected by our proposed rules.
16. Other Toll Carriers.  Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a definition for 
small businesses specifically applicable to Other Toll Carriers.  This category includes toll carriers that do 
not fall within the categories of interexchange carriers, operator service providers, prepaid calling card 
providers, satellite service carriers, or toll resellers.  The closest applicable NAICS Code category is for 
Wired Telecommunications Carriers as defined above.  Under the applicable SBA size standard, such a 
business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.46  Census data for 2012 shows that there were 3,117 
firms that operated that year.  Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.
47
  Thus, 
under this category and the associated small business size standard, the majority of Other Toll Carriers 
can be considered small.  According to internally developed Commission data, 284 companies reported 
that their primary telecommunications service activity was the provision of other toll carriage.48  Of 
these, an estimated 279 have 1,500 or fewer employees.49  Consequently, the Commission estimates that 
most Other Toll Carriers are small entities that may be affected by rules adopted pursuant to the Notice.
4. Wireless Providers – Fixed and Mobile
17. The broadband Internet access service provider category covered by these proposed rules 
may cover multiple wireless firms and categories of regulated wireless services.  Thus, to the extent the 
wireless services listed below are used by wireless firms for broadband Internet access service, the 
proposed actions may have an impact on those small businesses as set forth above and further below.  In 
addition, for those services subject to auctions, we note that, as a general matter, the number of winning 
bidders that claim to qualify as small businesses at the close of an auction does not necessarily represent 
the number of small businesses currently in service.  Also, the Commission does not generally track 
subsequent business size unless, in the context of assignments and transfers or reportable eligibility 
events, unjust enrichment issues are implicated.
18. Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite). This industry comprises 
establishments engaged in operating and maintaining switching and transmission facilities to provide 
communications via the airwaves.  Establishments in this industry have spectrum licenses and provide 
services using that spectrum, such as cellular services, paging services, wireless internet access, and 
wireless video services.
50
  The appropriate size standard under SBA rules is that such a business is small 
if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.
51
  For this industry, U.S. Census data for 2012 show that there were 
967 firms that operated for the entire year.
52
  Of this total, 955 firms had employment of 999 or fewer

47
employees and 12 had employment of 1000 employees or more.
53
  Thus under this category and the 
associated size standard, the Commission estimates that the majority of wireless telecommunications 
carriers (except satellite) are small entities.  
19.   The Commission’s own data—available in its Universal Licensing System—indicate 
that, as of October 25, 2016, there are 280 Cellular licensees that will be affected by our actions today.
54
  
The Commission does not know how many of these licensees are small, as the Commission does not 
collect that information for these types of entities. Similarly, according to internally developed 
Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in the provision of wireless telephony, 
including cellular service, Personal Communications Service, and Specialized Mobile Radio Telephony 
services.
55
  Of this total, an estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees, and 152 have more than 1,500 
employees.
56
  Thus, using available data, we estimate that the majority of wireless firms can be 
considered small.  
20. Wireless Communications Services.  This service can be used for fixed, mobile, 
radiolocation, and digital audio broadcasting satellite uses.  The Commission defined “small business” for 
the wireless communications services (WCS) auction as an entity with average gross revenues of $40 
million for each of the three preceding years, and a “very small business” as an entity with average gross 
revenues of $15 million for each of the three preceding years.
57
  The SBA has approved these 
definitions.
58
  
21. 1670–1675 MHz Services.  This service can be used for fixed and mobile uses, except
aeronautical mobile.
59
  An auction for one license in the 1670–1675 MHz band was conducted in 2003.  
One license was awarded.  The winning bidder was not a small entity.
22. Wireless Telephony.  Wireless telephony includes cellular, personal communications 
services, and specialized mobile radio telephony carriers.  As noted, the SBA has developed a small 
business size standard for Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite).
60
  Under the SBA 
small business size standard, a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.
61
  According to 
Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were engaged in wireless telephony.
62
  Of these, an

Id.  Available census data do not provide a more precise estimate of the number of firms that have employment of 
1,500 or fewer employees; the largest category provided is for firms with “1000 employees or more.”
54
See http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls. For the purposes of this FRFA, consistent with Commission practice for wireless 
services, the Commission estimates the number of licensees based on the number of unique FCC Registration 
Numbers.

estimated 261 have 1,500 or fewer employees and 152 have more than 1,500 employees.
63
  Therefore, a 
little less than one third of these entities can be considered small.
23. Broadband Personal Communications Service.  The broadband personal communications 
services (PCS) spectrum is divided into six frequency blocks designated A through F, and the 
Commission has held auctions for each block.  The Commission initially defined a “small business” for 
C- and F-Block licenses as an entity that has average gross revenues of $40 million or less in the three 
previous calendar years.
64
  For F-Block licenses, an additional small business size standard for “very 
small business” was added and is defined as an entity that, together with its affiliates, has average gross 
revenues of not more than $15 million for the preceding three calendar years.
65
  These small business size 
standards, in the context of broadband PCS auctions, have been approved by the SBA.
66
  No small 
businesses within the SBA-approved small business size standards bid successfully for licenses in Blocks 
A and B.  There were 90 winning bidders that claimed small business status in the first two C-Block 
auctions.  A total of 93 bidders that claimed small business status won approximately 40 percent of the 
1,479 licenses in the first auction for the D, E, and F Blocks.
67
  On April 15, 1999, the Commission 
completed the reauction of 347 C-, D-, E-, and F-Block licenses in Auction No. 22.
68
  Of the 57 winning 
bidders in that auction, 48 claimed small business status and won 277 licenses.
24. On January 26, 2001, the Commission completed the auction of 422 C and F Block 
Broadband PCS licenses in Auction No. 35.  Of the 35 winning bidders in that auction, 29 claimed small 
business status.
69
  Subsequent events concerning Auction 35, including judicial and agency 
determinations, resulted in a total of 163 C and F Block licenses being available for grant.  On February 
15, 2005, the Commission completed an auction of 242 C-, D-, E-, and F-Block licenses in Auction No. 
58.  Of the 24 winning bidders in that auction, 16 claimed small business status and won 156 licenses.
70
  
On May 21, 2007, the Commission completed an auction of 33 licenses in the A, C, and F Blocks in 
Auction No. 71.
71
  Of the 12 winning bidders in that auction, five claimed small business status and won 
18 licenses.
72
  On August 20, 2008, the Commission completed the auction of 20 C-, D-, E-, and F-Block

  Of the eight winning bidders for Broadband PCS licenses 
in that auction, six claimed small business status and won 14 licenses.
74
25. Specialized Mobile Radio Licenses.  The Commission awards “small entity” bidding 
credits in auctions for Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) geographic area licenses in the 800 MHz and 900 
MHz bands to firms that had revenues of no more than $15 million in each of the three previous calendar 
years.
75
  The Commission awards “very small entity” bidding credits to firms that had revenues of no 
more than $3 million in each of the three previous calendar years.
76
  The SBA has approved these small 
business size standards for the 900 MHz Service.
77
  The Commission has held auctions for geographic 
area licenses in the 800 MHz and 900 MHz bands.  The 900 MHz SMR auction began on December 5, 
1995, and closed on April 15, 1996.  Sixty bidders claiming that they qualified as small businesses under 
the $15 million size standard won 263 geographic area licenses in the 900 MHz SMR band.  The 800 
MHz SMR auction for the upper 200 channels began on October 28, 1997, and was completed on 
December 8, 1997.  Ten bidders claiming that they qualified as small businesses under the $15 million 
size standard won 38 geographic area licenses for the upper 200 channels in the 800 MHz SMR band.
78
  A 
second auction for the 800 MHz band was held on January 10, 2002 and closed on January 17, 2002 and 
included 23 BEA licenses.  One bidder claiming small business status won five licenses.
79
26. The auction of the 1,053 800 MHz SMR geographic area licenses for the General 
Category channels began on August 16, 2000, and was completed on September 1, 2000.  Eleven bidders 
won 108 geographic area licenses for the General Category channels in the 800 MHz SMR band and 
qualified as small businesses under the $15 million size standard.
80
  In an auction completed on December 
5, 2000, a total of 2,800 Economic Area licenses in the lower 80 channels of the 800 MHz SMR service 
were awarded.
81
  Of the 22 winning bidders, 19 claimed small business status and won 129 licenses.  
Thus, combining all four auctions, 41 winning bidders for geographic licenses in the 800 MHz SMR band 
claimed status as small businesses.
27. In addition, there are numerous incumbent site-by-site SMR licenses and licensees with 
extended implementation authorizations in the 800 and 900 MHz bands.  We do not know how many 
firms provide 800 MHz or 900 MHz geographic area SMR service pursuant to extended implementation 
authorizations, nor how many of these providers have annual revenues of no more than $15 million.  One 
firm has over $15 million in revenues.  In addition, we do not know how many of these firms have 1,500 
or fewer employees, which is the SBA-determined size standard.
82
  We assume, for purposes of this

analysis, that all of the remaining extended implementation authorizations are held by small entities, as 
defined by the SBA.
28. Lower 700 MHz Band Licenses.  The Commission previously adopted criteria for 
defining three groups of small businesses for purposes of determining their eligibility for special 
provisions such as bidding credits.
83
  The Commission defined a “small business” as an entity that, 
together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues not exceeding $40 
million for the preceding three years.
84
  A “very small business” is defined as an entity that, together with 
its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues that are not more than $15 million for 
the preceding three years.
85
  Additionally, the lower 700 MHz Service had a third category of small 
business status for Metropolitan/Rural Service Area (MSA/RSA) licenses—“entrepreneur”—which is 
defined as an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross revenues 
that are not more than $3 million for the preceding three years.
86
  The SBA approved these small size 
standards.
87
  An auction of 740 licenses (one license in each of the 734 MSAs/RSAs and one license in 
each of the six Economic Area Groupings (EAGs)) commenced on August 27, 2002, and closed on 
September 18, 2002.  Of the 740 licenses available for auction, 484 licenses were won by 102 winning 
bidders.  Seventy-two of the winning bidders claimed small business, very small business or entrepreneur 
status and won a total of 329 licenses.
88
  A second auction commenced on May 28, 2003, closed on June 
13, 2003, and included 256 licenses:  5 EAG licenses and 476 Cellular Market Area licenses.
89
  Seventeen 
winning bidders claimed small or very small business status and won 60 licenses, and nine winning 
bidders claimed entrepreneur status and won 154 licenses.
90
  On July 26, 2005, the Commission 
completed an auction of 5 licenses in the Lower 700 MHz band (Auction No. 60).  There were three 
winning bidders for five licenses.  All three winning bidders claimed small business status.
29. In 2007, the Commission reexamined its rules governing the 700 MHz band in the 700 
MHz Second Report and Order.
91
  An auction of 700 MHz licenses commenced January 24, 2008 and 
closed on March 18, 2008, which included, 176 Economic Area licenses in the A Block, 734 Cellular 
Market Area licenses in the B Block, and 176 EA licenses in the E Block.
92
  Twenty winning bidders, 
claiming small business status (those with attributable average annual gross revenues that exceed $15

winning bidders claiming very small business status (those with attributable average annual gross 
revenues that do not exceed $15 million for the preceding three years) won 325 licenses.
30. Upper 700 MHz Band Licenses.  In the 700 MHz Second Report and Order, the 
Commission revised its rules regarding Upper 700 MHz licenses.
93
  On January 24, 2008, the 
Commission commenced Auction 73 in which several licenses in the Upper 700 MHz band were 
available for licensing:  12 Regional Economic Area Grouping licenses in the C Block, and one 
nationwide license in the D Block.
94
  The auction concluded on March 18, 2008, with 3 winning bidders 
claiming very small business status (those with attributable average annual gross revenues that do not 
exceed $15 million for the preceding three years) and winning five licenses.
31. 700 MHz Guard Band Licensees.  In 2000, in the 700 MHz Guard Band Order, the 
Commission adopted size standards for “small businesses” and “very small businesses” for purposes of 
determining their eligibility for special provisions such as bidding credits and installment payments.
95
  A 
small business in this service is an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has 
average gross revenues not exceeding $40 million for the preceding three years.
96
  Additionally, a very 
small business is an entity that, together with its affiliates and controlling principals, has average gross 
revenues that are not more than $15 million for the preceding three years.
97
  SBA approval of these 
definitions is not required.
98
  An auction of 52 Major Economic Area licenses commenced on September 
6, 2000, and closed on September 21, 2000.
99
  Of the 104 licenses auctioned, 96 licenses were sold to nine 
bidders.  Five of these bidders were small businesses that won a total of 26 licenses.  A second auction of 
700 MHz Guard Band licenses commenced on February 13, 2001, and closed on February 21, 2001.  All 
eight of the licenses auctioned were sold to three bidders.  One of these bidders was a small business that 
won a total of two licenses.
100
32. Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service.  The Commission has previously used the SBA’s 
small business size standard applicable to Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite), i.e., 
an entity employing no more than 1,500 persons.
101
  There are approximately 100 licensees in the Air-
Ground Radiotelephone Service, and under that definition, we estimate that almost all of them qualify as 
small entities under the SBA definition.  For purposes of assigning Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service 
licenses through competitive bidding, the Commission has defined “small business” as an entity that, 
together with controlling interests and affiliates, has average annual gross revenues for the preceding

three years not exceeding $40 million.
102
  A “very small business” is defined as an entity that, together 
with controlling interests and affiliates, has average annual gross revenues for the preceding three years 
not exceeding $15 million.
103
  These definitions were approved by the SBA.
104
  In May 2006, the 
Commission completed an auction of nationwide commercial Air-Ground Radiotelephone Service 
licenses in the 800 MHz band (Auction No. 65).  On June 2, 2006, the auction closed with two winning 
bidders winning two Air-Ground Radiotelephone Services licenses.  Neither of the winning bidders 
claimed small business status.
33. AWS Services (1710–1755 MHz  and 2110–2155 MHz bands (AWS-1); 1915–1920 MHz, 
1995–2000 MHz, 2020–2025 MHz and 2175–2180 MHz bands (AWS-2); 2155–2175 MHz band (AWS-
3)).  For the AWS-1 bands,
105
the Commission has defined a “small business” as an entity with average 
annual gross revenues for the preceding three years not exceeding $40 million, and a “very small 
business” as an entity with average annual gross revenues for the preceding three years not exceeding $15 
million.  For AWS-2 and AWS-3, although we do not know for certain which entities are likely to apply 
for these frequencies, we note that the AWS-1 bands are comparable to those used for cellular service and 
personal communications service.  The Commission has not yet adopted size standards for the AWS-2 or 
AWS-3 bands but proposes to treat both AWS-2 and AWS-3 similarly to broadband PCS service and 
AWS-1 service due to the comparable capital requirements and other factors, such as issues involved in 
relocating incumbents and developing markets, technologies, and services.
106
34. 3650–3700 MHz band.  In March 2005, the Commission released a Report and Order 
and Memorandum Opinion and Order that provides for nationwide, non-exclusive licensing of terrestrial 
operations, utilizing contention-based technologies, in the 3650 MHz band (i.e., 3650–3700 MHz).  As of 
April 2010, more than 1270 licenses have been granted and more than 7433 sites have been registered.  
The Commission has not developed a definition of small entities applicable to 3650–3700 MHz band 
nationwide, non-exclusive licensees.  However, we estimate that the majority of these licensees are 
Internet Access Service Providers (ISPs) and that most of those licensees are small businesses.
35. Fixed Microwave Services.  Microwave services include common carrier,
107
private-
operational fixed,
108
and broadcast auxiliary radio services.
109
  They also include the Local Multipoint

approximately 135 LMDS licensees, three DEMS licensees, and three 24 GHz licensees.  The 
Commission has not yet defined a small business with respect to microwave services.  For purposes of the 
IRFA, we will use the SBA’s definition applicable to Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except 
satellite)—i.e., an entity with no more than 1,500 persons.

does not have data specifying the number of these licensees that have more than 1,500 employees, and 
thus is unable at this time to estimate with greater precision the number of fixed microwave service 
licensees that would qualify as small business concerns under the SBA’s small business size standard.  
Consequently, the Commission estimates that there are up to 36,708 common carrier fixed licensees and 
up to 59,291 private operational-fixed licensees and broadcast auxiliary radio licensees in the microwave 
services that may be small and may be affected by the rules and policies adopted herein.  We note, 
however, that the common carrier microwave fixed licensee category includes some large entities.  
36. Broadband Radio Service and Educational Broadband Service.  Broadband Radio 
Service systems, previously referred to as Multipoint Distribution Service (MDS) and Multichannel 
Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) systems, and “wireless cable,” transmit video programming to 
subscribers and provide two-way high speed data operations using the microwave frequencies of the 
Broadband Radio Service (BRS) and Educational Broadband Service (EBS) (previously referred to as the 
Instructional Television Fixed Service (ITFS)).
116
  In connection with the 1996 BRS auction, the 
Commission established a small business size standard as an entity that had annual average gross 
revenues of no more than $40 million in the previous three calendar years.
117
  The BRS auctions resulted 
in 67 successful bidders obtaining licensing opportunities for 493 Basic Trading Areas (BTAs).  Of the 67 
auction winners, 61 met the definition of a small business.  BRS also includes licensees of stations 
authorized prior to the auction.  At this time, we estimate that of the 61 small business BRS auction 
winners, 48 remain small business licensees.  In addition to the 48 small businesses that hold BTA 
authorizations, there are approximately 392 incumbent BRS licensees that are considered small entities.
118
  
After adding the number of small business auction licensees to the number of incumbent licensees not 
(Continued from previous page)                                                            
microwave stations are used for relaying broadcast television signals from the studio to the transmitter, or between 
two points such as a main studio and an auxiliary studio.  The service also includes mobile TV pickups, which relay 
signals from a remote location back to the studio.

already counted, we find that there are currently approximately 440 BRS licensees that are defined as 
small businesses under either the SBA or the Commission’s rules.
37. In 2009, the Commission conducted Auction 86, the sale of 78 licenses in the BRS 
areas.
119
  The Commission offered three levels of bidding credits: (i) a bidder with attributed average 
annual gross revenues that exceed $15 million and do not exceed $40 million for the preceding three 
years (small business) received a 15 percent discount on its winning bid; (ii) a bidder with attributed 
average annual gross revenues that exceed $3 million and do not exceed $15 million for the preceding 
three years (very small business) received a 25 percent discount on its winning bid; and (iii) a bidder with 
attributed average annual gross revenues that do not exceed $3 million for the preceding three years 
(entrepreneur) received a 35 percent discount on its winning bid.
120
  Auction 86 concluded in 2009 with 
the sale of 61 licenses.
121
  Of the ten winning bidders, two bidders that claimed small business status won 
4 licenses; one bidder that claimed very small business status won three licenses; and two bidders that 
claimed entrepreneur status won six licenses.
38. In addition, the SBA’s Cable Television Distribution Services small business size 
standard is applicable to EBS.  There are presently 2,436 EBS licensees.  All but 100 of these licenses are 
held by educational institutions.  Educational institutions are included in this analysis as small entities.
122
  
Thus, we estimate that at least 2,336 licensees are small businesses.  Since 2007, Cable Television 
Distribution Services have been defined within the broad economic census category of Wired 
Telecommunications Carriers; that category is defined as follows:  “This industry comprises 
establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to transmission facilities and 
infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using 
wired telecommunications networks.  Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a 
combination of technologies.”
123
  The SBA has developed a small business size standard for this category, 
which is:  all such firms having 1,500 or fewer employees.  To gauge small business prevalence for these 
cable services we must, however, use the most current census data that are based on the previous category 
of Cable and Other Program Distribution and its associated size standard; that size standard was:  all such 
firms having $13.5 million or less in annual receipts.
124
  According to Census Bureau data for 2007, there 
were a total of 996 firms in this category that operated for the entire year.
125
  Of this total, 948 firms had 
annual receipts of under $10 million, and 48 firms had receipts of $10 million or more but less than $25 
million.
126
  Thus, the majority of these firms can be considered small.

The term “small entity” within SBREFA applies to small organizations (nonprofits) and to small governmental

5. Satellite Service Providers
39. Satellite Telecommunications Providers.  Two economic census categories address the 
satellite industry.  Both categories have a small business size standard of $32.5 million or less in average 
annual receipts, under SBA rules.
127
  
40. Satellite Telecommunications. This category comprises firms “primarily engaged in 
providing telecommunications services to other establishments in the telecommunications and 
broadcasting industries by forwarding and receiving communications signals via a system of satellites or 
reselling satellite telecommunications.”
128
  The category has a small business size standard of $32.5 
million or less in average annual receipts, under SBA rules.
129
  For this category, Census Bureau data for 
2012 show that there were a total of 333 firms that operated for the entire year.
130
  Of this total, 299 firms 
had annual receipts of less than $25 million.
131
  Consequently, we estimate that the majority of satellite 
telecommunications providers are small entities.
41. All Other Telecommunications.  “All Other Telecommunications” is defined as follows:  
This U.S. industry is comprised of establishments that are primarily engaged in providing specialized 
telecommunications services, such as satellite tracking, communications telemetry, and radar station 
operation.  This industry also includes establishments primarily engaged in providing satellite terminal 
stations and associated facilities connected with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of 
transmitting telecommunications to, and receiving telecommunications from, satellite systems.  
Establishments providing Internet services or voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services via client-
supplied telecommunications connections are also included in this industry.
132
  The SBA has developed a 
small business size standard for “All Other Telecommunications,” which consists of all such firms with 
gross annual receipts of $32.5 million or less.133  For this category, census data for 2012 show that there 
were 1,442 firms that operated for the entire year.  Of these firms, a total of 1,400 had gross annual 
receipts of less than $25 million.134  Consequently, we estimate that the majority of All Other 
Telecommunications firms are small entities that might be affected by our action.
6. Cable Service Providers
42. Because section 706 requires us to monitor the deployment of broadband using any 
technology, we anticipate that some broadband service providers may not provide telephone service.  
Accordingly, we describe below other types of firms that may provide broadband services, including 
cable companies, MDS providers, and utilities, among others.
43. Cable and Other Subscription Programming. This industry comprises establishments 
primarily engaged in operating studios and facilities for the broadcasting of programs on a subscription or

fee basis. The broadcast programming is typically narrowcast in nature (.e.g. limited format, such as 
news, sports, education, or youth-oriented). These establishments produce programming in their own 
facilities or acquire programming from external sources. The programming material is usually delivered 
to a third party, such as cable systems or direct-to-home satellite systems, for transmission to viewers. 
135
The SBA has established a size standard for this industry stating that a business in this industry is small if 
it has 1,500 or fewer employees.
136
The 2012 Economic Census indicates that 367 firms were operational 
for that entire year. Of this total, 357 operated with less than 1,000 employees.
137
Accordingly we 
conclude that a substantial majority of firms in this industry are small under the applicable SBA size 
standard.
44. Cable Companies and Systems (Rate Regulation). The Commission has developed its 
own small business size standards for the purpose of cable rate regulation. Under the Commission's rules, 
a “small cable company” is one serving 400,000 or fewer subscribers nationwide.
138
Industry data 
indicate that there are currently 4,600 active cable systems in the United States.
139
  Of this total, all but 
eleven cable operators nationwide are small under the 400,000-subscriber size standard.
140
  In addition, 
under the Commission's rate regulation rules, a “small system” is a cable system serving 15,000 or fewer 
subscribers.
141
  Current Commission records show 4,600 cable systems nationwide. Of this total, 3,900 
cable systems have fewer than 15,000 subscribers, and 700 systems have 15,000 or more subscribers, 
based on the same records.
142
Thus, under this standard as well, we estimate that most cable systems are 
small entities.
45. Cable System Operators (Telecom Act Standard).  The Communications Act also 
contains a size standard for small cable system operators, which is “a cable operator that, directly or 
through an affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than 1 percent of all subscribers in the United States 
and is not affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual revenues in the aggregate exceed 
$250,000,000.”143  There are approximately 52,403,705 cable video subscribers in the United States 
today.
144
  Accordingly, an operator serving fewer than 524,037 subscribers shall be deemed a small 
operator if its annual revenues, when combined with the total annual revenues of all its affiliates, do not 
exceed $250 million in the aggregate.145  Based on available data, we find that all but nine incumbent 
cable operators are small entities under this size standard.146  We note that the Commission neither 
requests nor collects information on whether cable system operators are affiliated with entities whose

gross annual revenues exceed $250 million.
147
  Although it seems certain that some of these cable system 
operators are affiliated with entities whose gross annual revenues exceed $250 million, we are unable at 
this time to estimate with greater precision the number of cable system operators that would qualify as 
small cable operators under the definition in the Communications Act.
7. All Other Telecommunications
46. Electric Power Generators, Transmitters, and Distributors.  This U.S. industry is 
comprised of establishments that are primarily engaged in providing specialized telecommunications 
services, such as satellite tracking, communications telemetry, and radar station operation.  This industry 
also includes establishments primarily engaged in providing satellite terminal stations and associated 
facilities connected with one or more terrestrial systems and capable of transmitting telecommunications 
to, and receiving telecommunications from, satellite systems.  Establishments providing Internet services 
or voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) services via client-supplied telecommunications connections are 
also included in this industry.148  The SBA has developed a small business size standard for “All Other 
Telecommunications,” which consists of all such firms with gross annual receipts of $32.5 million or 
less.
149
  For this category, census data for 2012 show that there were 1,442 firms that operated for the 
entire year.  Of these firms, a total of 1,400 had gross annual receipts of less than $25 million.150  
Consequently, we estimate that the majority of these firms are small entities that may be affected by rules 
adopted pursuant to the Notice.
D. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance
Requirements for Small Entities
47. As indicated above, the Notice seeks comment on modifications to the Commission’s 
existing no-blocking rule, no-throttling rule, no paid prioritization rule, and transparency rule, and it 
proposes eliminating the Internet conduct standard.  While we anticipate that the removal or modification 
of burdensome regulations will lead to a long-term reduction in reporting, recordkeeping, or other 
compliance requirements on some small entities, the potential modifications, if adopted, could initially 
impose additional reporting, recordkeeping, or other compliance requirements on some small entities.
151
  
We seek comment on any other potential effects that could result from the changes proposed in the 
Notice, particularly as they relate to small businesses.
E. Steps Taken to Minimize the Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities,
and Significant Alternatives Considered
48. The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant alternatives that it has considered 
in reaching its proposed approach, which may include (among others) the following four alternatives:  
(1) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into 
account the resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of 
compliance or reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; (3) the use of performance, rather 
than design, standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for small 
entities.
152
  
                                                     
147
The Commission does receive such information on a case-by-case basis if a cable operator appeals a local 
franchise authority’s finding that the operator does not qualify as a small cable operator pursuant to section 
76.901(f) of the Commission’s rules. See 47 CFR § 76.901(f).

Federal Communications Commission FCC 17-60
58
49. The Notice specifically seeks comment on the reporting requirements imposed by the 
enhanced transparency rule, and whether modifying that rule would alleviate any regulatory burdens.
153
  
Additionally, we believe that the proposals contained within this Notice represent a significant 
consolidation and simplification for small entities from the rules imposed by the Title II Order.  The rules 
imposed by the Title II Order created heavy compliance burdens, and those burdens were particularly 
onerous for smaller providers without dedicated compliance staffs.
154
  By proposing the elimination of the 
general conduct standard, and seeking comment on the other rules imposed by the Title II Order, the 
Notice attempts to understand and mitigate the negative effects the Title II Order had on small businesses.  
More generally, by proposing to return to an information service classification for broadband Internet 
access services, the Notice seeks to reduce the burdens that Title II classification imposed.
155
50. The Commission also expects to consider the economic impact on small entities, as 
identified in comments filed in response to the Notice and this IRFA, in reaching its final conclusions and 
taking action in this proceeding.  We note that numerous small providers have already filed comments 
with the Commission expressing their support for the Commission’s proposed changes.
156
51. We seek comment here on the effect the various proposals described in the Notice, and 
summarized above, will have on small entities, and on what effect alternative rules would have on those 
entities.  How can the Commission achieve its goal of protecting and promoting an open Internet while 
also imposing minimal burdens on small entities?  We specifically note that within this Notice, we have 
sought comment on the effects on small business of the disclosures required by the transparency rule,
157
and we have emphasized the outsize regulatory burdens that Title II reclassification has placed on small 
internet providers.
158
  What other specific steps could the Commission take in this regard?
52. Since this Notice seeks to reduce the compliance burdens of ISPs through the removal of 
unnecessary regulation, it does not propose any alternative methods of reducing those burdens.  However, 
we seek comment from interested parties or any potential method of reducing compliance burdens and 
restoring Internet freedom that has not been proposed in this Notice.

STATEMENT OF
CHAIRMAN AJIT PAI
Re: Restoring Internet Freedom, WC Docket No. 17-108.
For nearly two decades, the Internet flourished under a bipartisan, light-touch regulatory 
framework.  In the span of recent memory, the Internet went from a university research project to an 
essential tool for participating in the modern world.
This success wasn’t an accident.  In 1996, President Clinton signed the Telecommunications Act 
of 1996 and established a national policy “to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that 
presently exists for the Internet . . . unfettered by Federal or State regulation.”
1
  In 1998, Senators Ron 
Wyden and John Kerry, among others, said that if the FCC “suddenly subject[ed] some or all information 
service providers to telephone regulation, it seriously would chill the growth and development of 
advanced services.”
2
  The next year, Democratic FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said that it “is not good for 
America” to “just pick up this whole morass of [telephone] regulation and dump it wholesale on the 
[Internet] pipe.”
3
  This wasn’t controversial.  It was the consensus.
And so it would remain for almost two decades.  Under this light-touch approach, the private 
sector invested in networks to the tune of $1.5 trillion.  Internet speeds accelerated from kilobits to 
gigabits per second.  Mobile connectivity expanded from 1G to 2G to 3G to 4G.  And an entire Internet 
economy sprung up to develop applications riding on those networks.  Online companies like Google, 
Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon grew from scratch to become global powerhouses.  In sum, we had a free 
and open Internet—one in which consumers reaped immense benefits.
The Internet wasn’t broken in 2015.  We were not living in a digital dystopia.  Nonetheless, the 
FCC that year succumbed to pressure from the White House and changed course.  Even though the FCC 
couldn’t find any evidence of market failure, it turned its back on almost two decades of success.  It
imposed upon all Internet service providers (ISPs), big and small, the heavy-handed regulatory 
framework designed during the Roosevelt Administration to micromanage the AT&T telephone 
monopoly.  These utility-style regulations, known as “Title II,” were and are like the proverbial 
sledgehammer being wielded against the flea—except that here, there was no flea.
As a result of these rules, small ISPs faced new regulatory burdens associated with common 
carrier compliance.  Innovative providers hoping to offer their customers new, even free services had to 
fear a Washington bureaucracy that might disapprove and take enforcement action against them.  With the 
possibility of broadband rate regulation looming on the horizon, companies investing in next-generation 
networks hesitated to build or expand networks, unsure of whether the government would let them 
compete in the free market.
Today, we propose to repeal utility-style regulation of the Internet.  We propose to return to the 
Clinton-era light-touch framework that has proven to be successful.  And we propose to put technologists 
and engineers, rather than lawyers and accountants, at the center of the online world.
The evidence so far strongly suggests that this is the right way to go.
Among our nation’s 12 largest Internet service providers, domestic broadband capital 
expenditures decreased by 5.6% percent, or $3.6 billion, between 2014 and 2016, the first two years of the

Title II era.

  This decline is extremely unusual.  It is the first time that such investment has declined 
outside of a recession in the Internet era.  To be sure, a study released by a pro-Title II special interest this 
week claimed that there had been no such decline.  But that report makes basic mistakes, like counting 
network investment in Mexico as network investment in the United States.
The investment pullback is affecting smaller providers too.  We’ve received letters from dozens 
of small ISPs explaining how Title II hurts.  Seventy fixed wireless Internet service providers say “[o]ur 
challenges are exacerbated by the Title II Order . . . which has significantly increased compliance burdens 
and regulatory risk through heavy-handed regulation that is rife with uncertainty.”
5
  Seven smaller mobile 
wireless providers tell us that “[t]he uncertainty surrounding the Title II regulatory framework for 
wireless broadband services hinders our ability to meet our customer[s]’ needs, burdens our companies 
with unnecessary and costly obligations and inhibits our ability to build and operate networks in rural 
America.”
6
  Twenty-two of the nation’s smallest ISPs report that they have “slowed, if not halted, the 
development and deployment of innovative new offerings.”
7
  Thirty-two rural ISPs point to “the 
bureaucratic straightjacket of outdated regulations known as Title II” as a barrier to the vigorous 
investment they want to pursue.
8
  And 19 non-profit municipal ISPs—that is, government-owned 
broadband providers, often championed by Title II advocates—observe that “[f]or the past two years, the 
substantial costs of the 2015 decision have harmed our businesses.”
9
Consider for a minute why these statements are important.  These are 150 small ISPs, most of 
which Americans have not heard of.  These are the very companies that are critical to injecting 
competition into the broadband marketplace.  These are the very companies that are critical to closing the 
digital divide by building out in lower-income rural and urban areas—areas that too often don’t see 
investment or are the first to see investment dry up.  And again, these are the very companies that are 
telling us that Title II makes it harder to connect Americans with digital opportunity.  It puts consumers 
last, not first, to push these companies out of the marketplace and stifle competition.
In addition to proposing to reverse the Title II classification, we are also proposing to eliminate 
the so-called “Internet conduct standard.”  This standard gives the FCC a roving mandate to review 
business models and prohibit service plans that benefit consumers.  With this expansive authority, the 
FCC could investigate any provider for offering the public virtually any service that the agency might find 
problematic.
10
  And that’s in fact what the FCC did.  Within months of conferring this new authority upon 
itself, the FCC met the enemy: consumer-friendly free data programs offered by several companies.  
Despite the then-leadership of the agency having deemed some of these programs “highly innovative and

To be sure, the Title II Order did allow a company to seek an “advisory opinion” as to the propriety of a particular 
business practice or service.  47 CFR § 8.18.  However, seeking the government’s blessing in advance is precisely 
the opposite of permission-less innovation.

competitive,” the FCC began investigating them.  Preventing consumers from getting something for free 
doesn’t benefit consumers.
Additionally, this authority lets bureaucrats question whether literally every network management 
decision is “reasonable.”
11
  This is especially unwise when it comes to the networks of the future.  
Consider 5G, for instance—the next generation of wireless service.  The Economist recently explained 
what this technology will require: “slic[ing] the network into multiple ‘logical’ networks, each optimised 
for a different user’s needs.”
12
  Having to hire lawyers to make sure your engineers don’t run afoul of the 
FCC while pulling that off sounds like a recipe for disaster.  That helps explain why Marc Andreessen, 
the creator of the Netscape browser and a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist, has said: “If you 
have these pure net neutrality rules . . . you’re not ever going to get a return on continued network 
investment—which means you’ll stop investing in the network.”
13
* * *
Today’s Notice is the start of a new chapter in the public discussion about how we can best 
maintain a free and open Internet while making sure that ISPs have strong incentives to bring next-
generation networks and services to all Americans.
To reiterate, this is the beginning of the process, not the end.  The FCC is simply seeking 
comment on these proposals.  We also ask questions about the existing bright-line rules.  Over the next 90 
days, the American public will then have a chance to share its views on them.  And in the time to come, 
the FCC will follow the facts and the law where they take us.
Additionally, there are a few things that are different from the last time around.
First, we are proceeding in a far more transparent way than the FCC did in 2015.  Back then, it 
pushed through the 317-page Title II Order before anyone outside this building was allowed to see it.  
The draft document I proposed to my colleagues has been available to the public online for three weeks.  
Indeed, the public has already submitted over one million comments on that draft.  And I will go one step 
further and publicly commit to this:  On my watch, any order we may adopt in this proceeding will also 
be made widely available well before a vote is called.  You may agree or disagree with what the FCC is 
doing, but you have been and will be able to see what it is we’re doing and why.
Second, we aim to conduct a credible cost-benefit analysis of our policy decisions.  This simply 
wasn’t done back in 2015.  Indeed, the economic analysis in the Title II Order was called “wrong, 
unsupported, and irrelevant”—by the FCC’s own chief economist at the time.  This time, as we make our 
decisions, we will have our expert staff carefully review the evidence on investment and other variables.  
We will rely not on hyperbolic statements about “the end of the Internet as we know it” and 140-character 
commentary, but on the data. 
Finally, I’d like to thank the staff of the Wireline Competition Bureau, the Wireless 
Telecommunications Bureau, and the Office of General Counsel for their work on this document: Nathan 
Eagan, Kristine Fargotstein, David Horowitz, Madeleine Findley, Dan Kahn, Melissa Kirkel, Doug Klein, 
Marcus Maher, Rick Mallen, Kris Monteith, Linda Oliver, Bill Richardson, Suzanne Tetreault, and Ryan 
Yates.  I am deeply grateful to you for your hard work on this important issue.

DISSENTING STATEMENT OF

Re: Restoring Internet Freedom, WC Docket No. 17-108.

with an immediate crisis that requires immediate action.”

– Commissioner Pai, 2014 Open Internet NPRM Dissent
Last Wednesday, I took part in a public listening session in Skid Row. For those unfamiliar, Skid 
Row is a Los Angeles community, housing one of the largest homeless populations in the United States. It 
was there I met a fascinating woman who calls herself “Frenchie.” She would stop me about three times 
over the course of the evening; first going on about how much I looked just like my picture; next letting 
me know, how happy she was that someone like me would not only visit, but listen; but the third time 
turned out to be the most telling.
I was moments away from politely but firmly asking to be excused, when Frenchie said 
something that made me pause: When she was without a home in the traditional sense, she was able to 
secure an address, a stable, personal email address, which helped to ground her and enabled her to keep in 
touch with the world, through the power of the internet. That continuity, that identity, that stable 
electronic footprint, was at times the only permanent presence she had when much in her physical life was 
in turmoil. She got through the hardest times, she said, thanks to an open internet because those very same
connections, led her to the services that appear to be providing her a more stable life.
I also heard from Marco that night. The former filmmaker lost his family, his livelihood, and for a 
time, struggled with mental health issues. He lived in Skid Row, but the doctor who made the greatest 
headway with his recovery was more than 200 miles away in Fresno.
Rather than having to spend hours on public transportation, he was able to Skype with his 
therapist, and along with a friend in Argentina who spoke his language, and a clinician who was willing to 
pronounce his name correctly, he has gotten through the hardest of times, thanks to the power of an open 
internet. 
Denise, an artist, writer and mother of six, felt separated from the world because of the challenges 
of being a stay-at-home mom. She first turned to blogging as an avenue of expression, but that blog 
eventually became a retail outlet for her artistic work, as well as a source of income, that has enabled her 
and her husband, to support their family, thanks to the power of an open internet.
These are just three of the millions of examples of those whose lives have been uplifted by one of 
the most enabling platforms for speech, commerce, and innovation of our time. Like the nearly four 
million voices who weighed in on the previous proceeding just over two years ago, these three individuals 
asked that this agency keep the internet open and free. 
We can get hung up on semantics, debate classification, or whether the internet is a luxury, but 
broadband is a necessity in the 21
st
century and access to it allows the most vulnerable among us to hold 
on during our darkest moments, and lift ourselves up to a brighter tomorrow.
For those of us who are fortunate enough to have broadband access at home, and do not have to 
trek to a library and wait for a free terminal or troll for free Wi-Fi on street corners or fast food 
establishments, not only are you fortunate, but you know that it is among the first utilities you make sure 
is working, right after your electricity and water. And just what does one expect when you get connected?

Federal Communications Commission FCC 17-60
63
That you can run your online business, access content over the internet, and exercise free speech, without 
your service provider or anyone else getting in the way. 
Those expectations, it pains me to say, are now, at risk. 
Today’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, more appropriately known as the Destroying Internet 
Freedom NPRM, deeply damages the ability of the FCC to be a champion of consumers and competition 
in the 21
st
century. It contains a hollow theory of trickle-down internet economics, suggesting that if we 
just remove enough regulations from your broadband provider, they will automatically improve your 
service, pass along discounts from those speculative savings, deploy more infrastructure with haste, and 
treat edge providers fairly. 
It contains ideological interpretive whiplash, boldly proposing to gut the very same 
consumer and competition protections that have been twice-upheld by the courts. And it contains an 
approach to broadband that will throw universal service money to broaden its reach, but abandon users, 
when something goes wrong, particularly if they are faced with anti-competitive or anti-consumer 
practices.  It jeopardizes the ability of the open internet to function tomorrow as it does today. But if you 
unequivocally trust that your broadband provider will always put the public interest over their self-interest 
or the interest of their stockholders, then the Destroying Internet Freedom NPRM is for you.
I find it ironic, however, that many of the voices who support this item, including the majority at 
the Commission, said that it should be Congress’s place to decide the future of broadband regulation. If 
that is so, then why are we debating this today? Just why is it that the majority proposes to undo a twice-
affirmed classification, and twice-affirmed rules? Is it so Congress can act? A vacuous assertion.
But what I find particularly troubling, is that this proposal has the potential to damage our 
authority to help provide broadband for the poorest and most remotely-located Americans, unless the 
underlying goal, is to actually weaken our ability to support broadband through our universal service 
programs. 
The future of the internet is under attack. And so, I must vociferously dissent.
Process
This NPRM has all the indicia of a political rush job. Month after month, I listened to repeated 
calls from the current leadership, about how economic analyses were missing from the last 
administration’s items, how troubling that was, and because of the absence of this analysis, we were 
jeopardizing our ability to make sound decisions.  But unless I missed it, and I would welcome a 
correction if I am in error, there was no FCC staff economist or technologist, consulted during the 
drafting of this item. If they were, and I majored in Banking, Finance and Economics, but admittedly, I 
am out of practice, I cannot find any evidence of it, given the dearth of economic and technical depth in 
this NPRM.
For one, there is no cogent economic analysis to be found in this item. There is no discussion of 
consumer welfare, of two-sided markets, of market power, or any other standard economic concept that 
an item dealing with the regulatory structure of an entire industry would contain. While there is 
discussion of doing a cost-benefit analysis in the ultimate order, the NPRM does not seem to grapple with 
the fact that it is proposing an entirely different regulatory structure for the most vital communications 
service of the 21
st
century.  
As an example of the lack of depth, the NPRM contains a question that asks whether we have 
robust “intermodal broadband competition given the 4,559 Internet service providers now in the market?” 
This factoid fails to consider that most Americans lack options for robust fixed broadband because most 
of these providers are not competing against each other. By this logic, intermodal residential water 
Federal Communications Commission FCC 17-60
64
competition must be even more robust than broadband competition, since there are over 156,000 public 
water systems in the United States.
2
Yet everyone I know has one water line into their house.
Nor is there any technical depth to the item either. There are passing descriptions and assertions 
regarding how technology works, but for an item that purports to change direction based on how 
broadband technologies map onto technology-neutral regulatory definitions, there is precious little work 
done to show how that is the case.
For example, one paragraph asserts that broadband providers change the “form or content” of 
information and then cites firewalls and IPv4 and IPv6 address translation as proof of that assertion. 
Aside from the fact that firewalls generally function by blocking information that is not requested by the 
user, and that such firewalls usually are located at CPE at the demarcation point between the local area 
network and the wide area network (i.e., not within the broadband provider’s network), the NPRM does 
not even cite a technical basis for this contrary assertion. And, it similarly proclaims that dual-stack IP 
addressing somehow transforms the broadband service into an information service. This kind of protocol 
processing was always treated as a basic service.
3
And that is entirely apart from the process associated with this proceeding. The last time we 
started a proceeding like this, then-Commissioner Pai had some choice words for the Chairman on 
process. Let’s see whether he takes his own advice this time around:
? “I recommended that the Commission seek guidance from Congress instead of plowing 
ahead yet again on its own. In my view, recent events have only confirmed the wisdom of 
that approach.”
4
? “I am therefore disappointed that today, rather than turning to Congress, we have chosen 
to take matters into our own hands. It is all the more disappointing because we have been 
down this road before. Our prior two attempts to go it alone ended in court defeats.”
5
? “We should ask ten distinguished economists from across the country to study the impact 
of our proposed regulations and alternative approaches on the Internet ecosystem.”
6
? “We should also engage computer scientists, technologists, and other technical experts to 
tell us how they see the Internet’s infrastructure and consumers’ online experience 
evolving.”
7
? “And [decisions made] should avoid embroiling everyone, from the FCC to industry to 
the average American consumer, in yet another years-long legal waiting game.”

In the past, the Commission identified three categories of protocol processing services that would be treated as 
basic services. These categories include protocol processing: (1) involving communications between an end user and 
the network rather than between or among users; (2) in connection with the introduction of a new network 
technology which requires protocol conversion to maintain backwards compatibility; and (3) involving 
internetworking (conversions taking place solely within carrier networks to facilitate provision of a basic service that 
results in no net protocol conversion). Computer III Phase II Order, 2 FCC Rcd at 3081-82, paras. 64-71; Non-
Accounting Safeguards Order, 11 FCC Rcd at 21957-58, para. 106. IPv4/IPv6 conversion neatly falls into one of 
these categories, depending on how the protocol processing is utilized.

How did the Chairman fare against the standard he himself set? He fails on all accounts. Deciding to go it 
alone rather than wait for Congress to act? Check. No evidence of consultation with FCC staff economists 
or other outside economists? Check. No consultation of FCC staff technologists or other technologists? 
Check. More litigation on the horizon despite the D.C. Circuit’s double-stamp of approval? Check.
Now, let’s see whether some of Chairman Pai’s predictions when we adopted the 2015 Open 
Internet Order came true:
? “The courts will ultimately decide this Order’s fate. And I doubt they will countenance 
this unlawful power grab.”
9
? “[T]he FCC will regulate the rates that Internet service providers may charge.”
10
? “[I]t’s actually quite easy to envision this same Commission deciding to discard the 
predictive judgment that ex ante rate regulation is unnecessary.”
11
Again, he was wrong on all counts. The courts have upheld the 2015 Open Internet Order, and the FCC 
has not regulated rates for broadband any more than they have regulated rates for mobile voice service, 
which was originally subjected to Title II over two decades ago.
Economics
Despite all of the misleading talk about a lack of economic analysis in the 2015 Open Internet 
Order, this NPRM fares much worse. One would think that this would be a prime candidate for waiting 
until the Chairman’s Office of Economics and Data was stood up, but since this is such a political rush 
job, it is unsurprising that the Chairman declined to wait. Since this item fails to discuss the economics of 
an open internet, let me be the one to do so. 
Today’s broadband networks are multi-sided platforms. They create value by bringing together 
customers, services, and devices and facilitate interactions between all of them to create value for the 
entire internet ecosystem. When there is no platform competition, consumer and social welfare can suffer.
Most platform economics discussion relates to paid prioritization, which is offered up as a paean 
to standard economic theory of differential pricing, and of letting a two-sided market work to its fullest. 
The theory goes that by allowing payment for broadband providers prioritizing traffic, it incentivizes 
efficient use of the network by the application and services side of the market. But, this argument ignores 
that it is generally impossible for a customer or edge service to avoid going through the broadband 
provider, and thus survive a small but significant non-transitory increase in price (SSNIP). This pricing 
power has significant ramifications for the edge-side of the market, a point over which venture capitalists 
and edge providers have expressed significant concern.
A broadband provider is a monopoly platform when it comes to connecting edge providers to the 
broadband providers’ end-user customers. Every internet business depends on externalities associated 
with the broadband provider platform in order to function. If the broadband provider demands payment, 
the internet service must either pay, or lose a potential portion of its customer base. This is precisely the 
risk that the 2015 Open Internet Order sought to address: that a broadband provider as platform will set 
its overall price level in a way that does not maximize social welfare. And, there is no guarantee that 
introduction of additional friction into the broadband delivery model, by permitting broadband providers 
to erect tolls for content, will benefit anyone except the broadband provider and their shareholders.
Take the following example. If Netflix wishes to reach Comcast’s broadband customers, it cannot 
avoid going through Comcast. If Comcast begins imposing a toll for access to its customers, Netflix must

make the decision either to pay the toll or to forego accessing Comcast’s millions of broadband 
customers. The choice is clear, if unsavory: You pay the toll. That is why it is particularly concerning that 
this item proposes to decline to assert jurisdiction over interconnection. Even if the end-game of this 
proceeding is to adopt open internet rules—a proposition which I seriously doubt—this gives broadband 
providers a loophole big enough to drive a truck through. Indeed, we have seen evidence of these actions 
at the interconnection point in the past.
12
Consider how much more a small content provider would have 
to worry about tolls or interconnection blockades when it does not even have the clout of a much larger 
company.
Or, on the other end of the platform, consider a rural consumer with just one option for 
broadband. In order to save money, the consumer would like to use free or lower cost over-the-top voice 
services rather than subscribe to the local broadband provider’s voice service. But the provider blocks the 
ports necessary for that competing service to function. That is again leveraging the consumer-facing side 
of the two-sided market to harm edge competition and reduce consumer welfare. Each member of this 
Commission—myself included—feels strongly about not supporting multiple broadband providers in a 
given geographic area with federal universal service money. But it makes no sense to stand up a 
broadband monopoly in an area and simultaneously be unwilling to provide consumer protections to 
prevent that broadband provider from leveraging its market position to reduce consumer welfare.
More broadly, permission-less innovation has been the bedrock of American internet policy for 
decades. The principle is simple:  those at either end of the network should not have to worry about 
actions of those in the middle to negatively impact their business. The construct the majority would stand 
up here would ensure that, on the content and device side, the little guys on the edge of the network will 
have to worry about negotiating with thousands of broadband providers to ensure their services reach 
their customers. And, on the consumer side, customers with little to no choice of broadband providers will 
have to live with whatever their broadband provider decides to enable them to access. That is entirely 
inconsistent with consumer and business expectations about the open and free nature of the internet. 
Debunked Predictions about Title II
There have been so many false claims about what reclassification would do to the internet, the 
economy, and the consumer. None has come to pass. 
For example, leading up to the adoption of the 2015 Open Internet Order, detractors of Title II 
predicted that consumer broadband would become significantly more expensive. The Progressive Policy 
Institute claimed that $15 billion in new state and federal taxes would be imposed as a result of the 
decision to adopt strong, Title II open internet rules.
13
One company’s CEO claimed that average 
household broadband bill would increase by $19 a month as a result of these new taxes and fees.
14
Those 
predictions did not come to pass. Not surprising, they do not merit a mention in this NPRM. 
Then-Commissioner Pai devoted his entire dissent to 2015 Open Internet Order on legal 
disagreements with the majority.
15
Twice, the D.C. Circuit upheld the Order. Yet, we move forward into 
the breach with more uncertainty and legal risk.

Another amorphous allegation is that the 2015 Open Internet Order puts the brakes on numerous 
new features and services that people are now afraid to roll out. Yet, I have not heard a single concrete 
example a service or feature that was not offered because of the open internet rules.
The only factual question about the effects of the 2015 Open Internet Order that the majority 
keeps trying to drive home is their assertion that it has harmed investment. But the NPRM presents at 
most one third of the economic picture of the market. From reading the item, it would be reasonable to 
assume that the key open internet policy question is whether a policy increases or decreases broadband 
provider capital expenditures. It is a relevant question, but the only econometric analysis that the majority 
cites for support clearly states that it is “inappropriate [to] use . . . investment as a policy objective.”
16
The NPRM trots out numerous anecdotes of harmed investment, but even these are of 
questionable value. For example, Wisper is a wireless ISP that filed for stay of the 2015 Open Internet 
Order, stating it that planned to expand its network but the Commission’s reclassification decision had 
forced Wisper to put those plans on hold.
17
But just one month later, Wisper decided to purchase another 
broadband provider. “We look forward to upgrading the network, expanding coverage and providing 
super-fast speeds in the Lincoln County areas,” their CEO said in a statement.
18
Then, a year ago, they 
bought another provider. “Wisper plans to upgrade the current Stouffer network to Wisper standards and 
hopes to offer faster speeds in the future,” their CEO said again.
19
As with Wisper, I wonder how many 
ISPs simply made the minor adjustments necessary to adapt to the new regulatory reality and moved on 
with their business. I suspect that many signatories of the letters that the Chairman cites as concrete 
evidence that Title II has hurt investment will do the same.
Even if I accepted the majority’s premise that the key question is investment, the NPRM’s 
analysis fails to take into account what entrepreneurs invest in their internet business, what risk venture 
capitalists plow into the internet and telecom market, and what consumers pay for and how they use all 
these services to create economic value. It even fails to account for broadband investments made beyond 
narrow capital expenditures, including spectrum purchases and M&A, both of which are indicia of a 
robust and profitable market for broadband services. The majority seems willfully blind to these aspects 
of broadband investment.
Even if we were to ignore all those points and narrowly focus on the affirmative case that the 
majority puts forth, it is lackluster at best. As I have mentioned previously, I have yet to see a credible 
analysis that suggests that broadband provider capital expenditures have declined as a result of our 2015 
Open Internet Order. But of course, that does not keep those dead set on dismantling the open internet 
protections as we known them from repeating the same tired and unproven talking points.
For example, Chairman Pai told the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this year that 
investment in broadband was down. The source of his statistic? USTelecom, a group that lobbied against

So, in this NPRM, the Commission adds a new source—the author of the study 
that made the now-debunked “$15 billion in new taxes” prediction.
21
While alternative analyses have 
suggested investment increases,
22
underlying that approach is a methodology that ignores the need for 
advance capex planning and other forms of capital expenditures that are not neatly captured on the single 
line of a provider’s 10-K statement. Even if this analysis was correct that broadband investment has 
decreased, it is still deeply flawed because it assumes correlation is causation. Using the same logic that 
the NPRM uses, one could suggest that the FCC’s classification of cable modem service as an 
information service in 2002 resulted in an even more precipitous drop in broadband provider 
investment.
23
Indeed, the highest levels of broadband investment in the past two decades were under the 
Title II line sharing and network unbundling regime in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
24
The NPRM cites 
only one econometric study that purports to use a causative approach to investment, and even it uses too 
broad a time period for Title II treatment and does not use telecommunications data for the counterfactual 
to analyze the impact of Title II, subjecting the regressions to all sorts of errors.
The most recent analysis on the market suggests that total capital investment by publicly-traded 
ISPs was up five percent since the 2015 Open Internet Order was adopted. Edge investments are up. 
Broadband revenues are up. This makes sense, since no broadband provider has ever told Wall Street or 
the Securities and Exchange Commission that the 2015 Open Internet Order was responsible for 
decreases in capital expenditures.
So why is it literally a he-said she-said exchange on this issue? One analyst articulates that “it’s 
impossible to tell whether the open internet rules have affected investment. There’s no way to provide a 
serious answer that rises above simply trying to reverse engineer the answer you want to find.”
25
There 
simply has not been enough market experience with this framework in order to tell what caused what. 
So what then should we look to for answers on this question?
With all of the assertions about how burdensome and draconian the current framework is, what 
should be instructive is that the Title II framework the FCC adopted for broadband in 2015 was actually 
less intrusive than the one that was applied to mobile voice in the early 1990s. Now we all know how 
much of a bust that wireless industry has been, right? Between 1993 and 2009, the mobile industry 
invested more than $271 billion, in building out networks. During the same time period, industry 
revenues increased by 1300 percent, and subscribership grew over 1600 percent. So answer this: why is it 
that the leadership is now proposing to get rid of what is essentially the same legal framework that we 
know was a highly successful driver in the mobile industry context?

Whither Telecommunications Services?
On to the legal analysis.
It is clear that this majority is willing to read the definition of telecommunications service out of 
the Communications Act altogether—not only for broadband, but for all consumer telecommunications 
services. Show me one modern consumer service that the majority will unequivocally say is a 
telecommunications service and its provider should be regulated as a common carrier. Broadband, VoIP, 
VoLTE messaging—all of these I suspect the majority would say are either unequivocally or most likely 
information services. There is much sound and fury about applying a Depression-Era Communications 
Act to modern communications services, but none about applying the Revolutionary-Era First 
Amendment to speech on the Internet. The point is this: technology-neutral definitions do not become 
obsolete by advances in technology.
How can we give meaning to all statutory language if we decide to read, not only a word or 
phrase, but an entire Title out of the Communications Act? Rather than recognizing this and having an 
honest conversation about the underlying technology and consumer broadband market, statutory 
definitions are twisted to fit a deregulatory bent. But, by declining to classify VoIP, messaging, VoLTE 
and other services, the majority chips away at Congressionally-delegated authority service-by-service. 
The end-game is this: get the FCC out of the business of regulating in the public interest. This 
reclassification is but a step towards that goal.
But, let us turn to broadband specifically. Those in lock-step with the majority seem to be on 
board—at least so far—with a whiplash about-face on Title II and net neutrality under this 
Administration. But many are forgetful that their lodestar for Constitutional and statutory interpretation 
would conclude they are engaging in “interpretive jiggery-pokery”. 
The Heritage Foundation called the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia “a standard-
bearer” for conservative legal theory, and a “champion[] of originalism and textualism.”
26
FreedomWorks 
heralded his “enormous intellect and untiring devotion to objective, text-based interpretation.”
27
His 
guiding framework for legal interpretation was that “laws should be interpreted based on their actual text 
and original public meaning.”
28
But how quickly people forget when it comes to an issue where they have
a preferred policy outcome that diverges from rigorous textualism.
Remember, we have been here before. The FCC went before the Supreme Court in 2005 when it 
attempted to classify cable broadband as an information service. The majority of the court felt that such 
an interpretation was within the interpretive discretion of the FCC. But not Justice Scalia. In his withering 
dissent in NCTA v. Brand X, he accused the Commission of attempting to “concoct a whole new regime 
of regulation . . . under the guise of statutory construction.”
29
And its attempt to achieve this scheme of 
non-regulation? Done so “through an implausible reading of the statute.”
30
It is unsurprising that his 
opinion is not mentioned once in the NPRM.

Congress in its wisdom tied many of our competition and consumer protection functions to the 
nature of the service being offered. And indeed those services are changing, but the underlying 
transmission remains largely the same. Innovation, has, and will continue in the network. We have moved 
from copper to glass, and from circuit-switching to packet-switching. But using interpretive gymnastics to 
shirk those responsibilities is the antithesis of putting #ConsumersFirst. We cannot let broadband 
providers define the rules of engagement when Congress has clearly entrusted the Commission with that 
responsibility.
The arc of technology continues to bend away from legacy protocols like TDM and SS7 and 
towards modern ones like IPv6 and MPLS. Indeed, the majority believes that those trends should be 
supported and encouraged. Just last month we voted to explore ways to accelerate those transitions. But 
the majority forgets a simple fact: A shift in technology that powers the transmission of information via 
telecommunications does not alter the fact that telecommunications is occurring. We saw this in the shift 
from semaphore to telegraph, telegraph to telephone, and telephone to broadband.
But, the Commission here looks to skip down the same mistaken path of statutory interpretation 
that Justice Scalia complained of in 2005. Then, it was the word “offer.” Now, it is the words “capability” 
and “points.” If you were to believe the majority, broadband providers only offer you the “capability for 
generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available 
information via telecommunications.” There are two major problems with these readings: one legal, one 
practical. 
First, the legal. Interpreting “capability” this broadly reads “via telecommunications” out of the 
definition of information service all together. It is a basic canon of construction that we must read 
meaning into all parts of the statute. Putting aside that the majority would read the entirety of Title II out 
of the Act for all modern consumer services, under the majority’s proposed reading of the definition of 
information service, there is no provider of telecommunications whatsoever. And it would read into the 
term “capability” all of the functionality at the endpoint of the telecommunications. 
And, interpreting the definition of “telecommunications” so narrowly as to require consumers to 
specify the points along which they would like their communications routed would effectively read the 
definition out of the statute for any telecommunications service except for the most basic. No, users 
almost never specify the physical points to and by which their communications should be routed. Nor 
should they. It would be like ordering a package from Amazon and telling the USPS what warehouse you 
would like your package to originate from and what intermediate depots along the way you would like 
your package to terminate. The genius of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is that definitions permit 
abstraction. 
Second, the practical. No one seriously suggests, that by signing up for AT&T’s mobile 
broadband product that you will automatically be able to watch the latest episode of “Orange is the New 
Black”. Nor does anybody seriously suggest that by hopping in your car and driving to McDonalds that 
you automatically get a Big Mac. We do not conflate the origination of a separate service that utilizes the 
telecommunications network with the ability of a network to get you to that point in the first place. 
For example, telegraph service was always considered a Title II service. No one seriously argued 
that, for example, because wireless telegraph service was a broadcast service and the user did not know 
who would receive the telegraph signal, that it was any less a Title II service. Indeed one of the most 
famous uses of the telegraph was from the Titanic, a broadcast S.O.S. and several follow-up 
conversations with individual ships.
31
Nor did the advent of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 bring 
the underlying nature of the service into question.

Federal Communications Commission FCC 17-60
71
Similarly, telephone service was always considered a Title II service. A telephone subscriber 
never knew exactly where geographically she was dialing when she dialed an 800 number, but that did 
not change the fact that she was using a telecommunications service. A telephone subscriber never knew 
exactly where geographically a voice commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) customer was located, 
but that did not change the fact that she was using a telecommunications service. Nor did a telephone 
subscriber know what “points” along the network she was using when she used her telephone service as a 
dial-up internet service, but that did not change her telephone service into an information service. All this 
suggests that “points” should be interpreted much more abstractly than the actual physical location of a 
server, switch, or end-user. This is entirely consistent with viewing a service from the perspective of a 
consumer: they always know what they want to do, but they need the telecommunications service to make 
that happen. 
But, if we take the NPRM’s logic at face value, legacy voice providers would have always been 
information services providers, because a voice subscriber could acquire information from another person 
on the other end of the phone line. As the logic goes, dialing a random phone number and asking someone 
a question is just like typing in a random website and seeing what pops up on your screen.  News flash: 
the advent of the internet and the ability to utilize the same sort of telecommunications service used for 
making voice calls for broadband access did not somehow transform the underlying network itself. This 
was the genius of the basic and enhanced distinction, transmuted into the telecommunications and 
information service distinction (courtesy of Congress).  
The NPRM purports to use other contortions to find that broadband is not a telecommunications 
service. This includes relying on a facially unconstitutional statute,
32
an unenforceable policy statement,
33
and lawfully delegated and exercised Congressional authority,
34
as support for the “fact” that broadband is 
an information service. 
Just what are we doing here?
Would the same logic hold for mobile services? Do we seriously believe that mass-market mobile 
broadband, the broadband service that is most highly-adopted by Americans, is a “private carrier”-like 
service? The 2015 Open Internet Order offered independent justifications as to why this service is a 
CMRS.
35
The D.C. Circuit upheld these findings. We will certainly see logical contortions to find that a 
broadband service that runs over the exact same infrastructure as a voice CMRS service, and uses NANP 
numbers or IP addresses, is not interconnected with the public switched network. We will also see 
arguments that it is not even a functional equivalent of a CMRS service. Finally, we will even see efforts 
to write “telephone” into “public switched network” when Congress did no such thing and was more than 
capable of doing it themselves. They certainly knew how to do so with the multiple provisions in the 
Communications Act.
36
And, just to make it absolutely clear that this is an ends-justified than a legally-justified 
proceeding, one need only look to the toll-free numbering database for answers. That database is a 
tariffed common carrier service.
37
If mass-market broadband, which transmits data across the globe in the 
blink of an eye, is not a common carrier service and numbering database access is, this classification 
exercise is just an expedition into whimsical absurdity.

In sum, it simply makes no sense in the era of 21
st
century connectivity to say that there is no 
such thing as a telecommunications service. What are consumers purchasing, when they sign-up for 
broadband, if not the ability to transmit and receive? 
The majority claims it has an eye towards the future, but both feet are firmly stuck in the past, 
hearkening back to dial-up days where a subscriber purchased both a basic TDM telephony service, and a 
separate dial-up service in order to access the internet. No matter that most of us no longer dial-up to the 
internet, no matter that consumers buy broadband because all the information services they want to access 
and use, require the broadband subscription as a necessary prerequisite. But I should not be surprised that 
the majority is peering through the lens of yesteryear, for we just revived a 1985 technologically-obsolete 
UHF discount, so why not continue to wind back the clock and base our regulatory structure on a 1990’s 
version of the internet? 
Rules, or No Rules?
As far as the open internet rules go, this is Schrödinger’s NPRM: the text devoted to the open 
internet rules is so open-ended that the rules are both alive and dead until the Commission adopts an 
Order in this proceeding. 
Will any of the open internet rules survive this rulemaking? I am doubtful given both the tenor of 
the questioning, and the fact that the rulemaking is proposing to get rid of the only authority that would 
underpin strong open internet rules. Tellingly, the majority does not propose any provision of law to 
underpin any of the open internet rules on which it seeks comment.
The need for, and value of the open internet rules was lucidly articulated in both the 2010 Open 
Internet Order and 2015 Open Internet Order, so I will not repeat those here.
However, this proposal is frightening in its disregard for the actual experiences of consumers. 
How else could the majority suggest that basic transparency to consumers be more burdensome than it is 
worth? Rather than having to advertise and disclose in concrete detail what service is actually sold, we 
will see even more important consumer information buried in monolithic terms of service, enforceable via 
mandatory arbitration. That is, if such information is even disclosed at all.
The proposal to eliminate the general conduct rule is precisely in line with an end-game of 
ensuring there is no referee on the field for broadband. Many of the complaints regarding the rule, which 
simply states that a broadband provider may not unreasonably interfere or disadvantage the ability of 
consumers and edge providers to reach one another, could just as easily be levied at the statutory language 
that the Commission has interpreted and applied for decades—sections 201 and 202 of the Act. Using 
adjudication to define the contours of permissible conduct is a textbook example of well-functioning 
administrative law. 
As far as the bright line rules go, even the most vocal advocates for rolling back Title II are 
generally in favor of those rules. Why are we seeking comment on getting rid of them? In part, because 
we are getting rid of the authority for strong bright line rules, and even proposing to get rid of the 
authority that would have underpinned the weaker rules that were proposed in the 2014 Open Internet 
NPRM.
Of course, I am talking about section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. While paying 
lip service to the idea that we could ground open internet rules in other forms of statutory authority, like 
section 230(b)—which the Comcast court rejected—I am also concerned at the proposal to reinterpret 
section 706 as merely hortatory. We have litigated the statutory history, and courts have upheld our use of 
section 706 as a substantive grant of authority. Walking that interpretation back—particularly in a world 
where we do not have Title II—is a sure death sentence for any open internet rules. 
Undermining Universal Service
Like many of the Chairman’s other actions regarding Lifeline, I am concerned that the proposal to 
support broadband in the Lifeline program without Title II is a proposal to gut the program couched in 
Federal Communications Commission FCC 17-60
73
language that is masked as a desire to keep the program. The Chairman has said that “It’s vital that low-
income Americans have access to . . . broadband Internet, which Lifeline helps to achieve.” But, he 
kicked providers out of the program, shut the door on others trying to get in, and made clear he wants to 
revisit the mechanism for allowing broadband providers into the Lifeline program.
Section 254 requires support to go to telecommunications services and facilities supporting those 
services. It is clear that if broadband is a telecommunications service, it can be a Lifeline-supported 
service. But if broadband is not a telecommunications service, I ask: how will we bridge the affordability 
gap for those who cannot afford advanced telecommunications services?
We have confronted this problem before in the high-cost context in 2011. Then, it was logical and 
upheld by the courts that we could support a telecommunications service, but condition that support on 
the provision on funding broadband-capable networks and offering broadband service. But as networks 
continue to evolve, legacy voice popularity continues to decline, and VoIP and broadband become the 
communications services of the day, I again ask: what services can we legally support? In addition, many 
states have prohibited their public utility commissions from giving VoIP or broadband ETC designations. 
How will a broadband provider become certified to provide Lifeline broadband if there is no state 
authority to designate it as an ETC?
The proposal in the NPRM also seems to unduly limit the ability to participate in Lifeline to only 
facilities-based providers. This appears to be yet another way to undermine the program. It seems 
unthinkable to limit participation in the program in this way, particularly when some facilities-based 
providers are actively seeking to relinquish their Lifeline ETC designations. 
This reclassification also goes to the core of our universal service programs more generally. At a 
time when Members of Congress on a bicameral, bipartisan basis are en-masse suggesting that the FCC 
address the rural broadband issue, it seems odd that the Commission would propose moving forward on 
an item that would undermine our legal authority to support broadband in rural areas. As telephone 
service (i.e., the supported telecommunications service) continues to go the way of the dodo, can we 
support broadband-capable networks (i.e., the supported facilities) when there is no lawfully supported 
telecommunications service to which universal service funding will attach? Given that no modern 
communications service is a telecommunications service in the eyes of this Commission majority, how do 
we continue to base our universal service policies on the 2011 USF/ICC Transformation Order’s support 
of broadband networks and voice services?
38
Again, what is the supported telecommunications service?
No More Privacy?
The item proposes to quietly ensure that broadband customers have no privacy protections 
whatsoever, shirking our privacy responsibilities under the Communications Act. The majority knows 
that we cannot simply let the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) take the helm on broadband provider 
privacy practices while there is still a chance that if a provider offers legacy voice their broadband 
service—irrespective of classification—is likely out of bounds for the FTC. While it is heartening for 
consumers that the case that limits the FTC’s authority is slated for rehearing, it is still unclear whether 
the FTC can enforce broadband privacy until the full 9th Circuit opines.
39
Cost-Benefit Analysis
I am supportive of properly evaluating the costs and benefits of proposed regulations. However, 
in the case of this proceeding, calls for a cost benefit analysis appear to be no more than a charade to 
suggest that open internet regulation has onerous effects.
First, the Chairman has not sought any credible economic input on the NPRM we are adopting 
today. Again, my understanding is that no staff economist or technologist at the FCC was consulted on

the details of this item. This is contrary to his dissent of the 2014 Open Internet NPRM where he 
suggested we needed ten independent economic studies before moving forward on an item. Might makes 
right, apparently, since we are willing to dispense with what he previously suggested we should do simply 
because he believes the FCC did the wrong thing and he is now in charge.
Second, the NPRM waxes eloquent about needing to select the correct baseline, but then proposes 
to select the wrong baseline. As OMB Circular A-4 explains, “[t]his baseline should be the best 
assessment of the way the world would look absent the proposed action.”
40
The proposed action here is 
reversing the telecommunications service classification for broadband, and eliminating all open internet 
rules. Yet the item says it proposes to select the regulatory state of affairs at the end point of this 
proceeding (i.e., a world without open internet rules) as the baseline for judging the action taking during 
this proceeding.
Conclusion
While the majority engages in flowery rhetoric about light-touch regulation, and so on, the 
endgame appears to be no-touch regulation and a wholescale destruction of the FCC’s public interest 
authority in the 21
st
century: Undermining the ability of poor people to get broadband, knee-capping 
funding for rural telecommunications, declining to review an $85 billion transaction with massive public 
interest implications, encouraging consolidation and higher prices in business broadband, enabling 
massive broadcasting conglomerates to gobble up more local voices. Each action is a cut against the 
public interest, and the majority will keep it coming, unless Americans stand up, make their voices heard 
and challenge the FCC in court, because it is glaringly obvious, with each open meeting, that the 
willingness and the ability of the majority to protect consumers and competition in a broadband era, has 
come to a screeching halt.
Nonetheless, I thank the staff of the Wireline Bureau and Office of General Counsel for their 
work on this item. I may think this rulemaking takes us down a horrible path, but your hard work should 
be recognized, regardless.

STATEMENT OF
COMMISSIONER MICHAEL O’RIELLY
Re: Restoring Internet Freedom, WC Docket No. 17-108.
Today we formally initiate the proceeding to consider reversing the 2015 Net Neutrality Order.  I 
dissented from that prior decision because I was not persuaded, based on the record before us, that there 
was evidence of harm to businesses or consumers that warranted the adoption of net neutrality rules, 
much less the imposition of heavy handed Title II regulation on broadband providers.  Now that we are
commencing a new proceeding, I will once again fulfill my obligation under the Administrative 
Procedure Act.  While I certainly have my views on the topic, I restate my approach to look to the law, 
the necessity for any rules and record of substantive comments that accumulates.  Thankfully, our 
rulemaking process is not decided like a Dancing with the Stars contest, since counts of comments 
submitted have only so much value.  
At the outset, I want to commend the Chairman for his leadership and staff for their excellent 
work on this item.  This proceeding is being conducted in an open and transparent manner, and all 
interested parties will have a full and fair opportunity to present comments, data, and analysis.  One of the 
reasons why I welcome the opportunity to revisit these rules is that the prior Commission changed course 
so abruptly that it did not take the time to sufficiently examine the law and record and did not adequately 
respond to opposing viewpoints and alternative proposals.  This time, I am confident that whether you 
agree or disagree on the need for net neutrality rules or our legal authority, you will see an order that fully 
and fairly responds to all substantive arguments.  
To help bring order and rigor to the debate to come, the Notice proposes to conduct an actual cost 
benefit analysis.  This is a critical improvement.  Instead of operating in an “economics free zone” where 
the benefits of rules are assumed to outweigh any costs, commenters will need to provide evidence to 
support their arguments that rules are, or are not, needed.  It will enable the Commission to ground its 
decision in facts rather than hypotheticals.  
The Notice also asks a full range of questions on the proper legal classification of broadband 
Internet access service.  These include critical questions that should have been explored and answered by 
the Commission before it barreled down the Title II path, disavowing decades of precedent and contrary 
interpretations that stood in its way.  Now the Commission presents the case that it previously ignored –
that the text of the Act, Commission precedent, and public policy support classification of broadband 
Internet access service as an information service.  
My primary goal with respect to this Notice has been to ensure that the Commission asks 
sufficient questions to lay the groundwork for a legally sustainable final decision.  Accordingly, any issue 
that is related to this proceeding and could be part of the decision should be on the table here.  One such 
issue concerns jurisdiction over broadband Internet access service.  If the Commission decides that it is an 
interstate information service, then states and localities should be foreclosed from regulating it, as some 
states are currently attempting to do with new broadband privacy laws, fees, approval processes, and other 
requirements.  I thank the Chairman for working with me by including a question to enable parties to 
submit comments and proposals on this issue.
I vote to approve.
